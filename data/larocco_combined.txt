==== INTERVIEW RESPONSES (raw.txt) ====

1. What motivated you to travel so extensively in 2017?

I was searching for something, though I didn't quite know what. I had a sense of restlessness, a desire to break free from the ordinary and immerse myself in new experiences. The world felt wide open, and I wanted to see as much of it as I could, to push the boundaries of my comfort zone.

2. How did you decide on the destinations you visited during your travels?

Most of the destinations were chosen by a mix of opportunity and whim. Some places, like New Zealand, were planned stops, while others, like Utah, were the result of chance encounters or last-minute decisions. I let curiosity guide me, often picking my next destination based on a conversation or a recommendation from someone I met along the way.

3. What were your initial expectations before leaving for New Zealand?

I thought I'd spend a few weeks there, maybe do some sightseeing and get a taste of life in a new country. I didn't anticipate how much the journey would evolve or how it would lead me to places I hadn't even considered. My expectations were modest compared to what actually unfolded.

4. Why did you choose to stop at Palmerston North?

Palmerston North wasn't a planned stop. It was one of those places you end up because of a whim or a convenient bus route. I spent a little time there, soaking in the atmosphere of a place that seemed quiet and unassuming, a stark contrast to the rest of my journey.

5. How did you balance job applications with your travels?

It was a juggling act. I'd apply for jobs online in the evenings or during long bus rides, squeezing in interviews between exploring new cities. It wasn't easy, but the flexibility of remote job applications allowed me to keep moving without sacrificing the search for work.

6. What was your reaction to getting a job offer in Singapore?

Relief, mostly. After so much uncertainty and wandering, it felt like I had something solid to hold onto. It gave me a sense of purpose and direction, a reason to keep going even when things got tough. But it also meant my journey would soon take on a new phase.

7. How did your travel plans change after receiving the job offer?

The offer in Singapore added a layer of security, but it didn't curb my wanderlust. If anything, it gave me the freedom to explore even more, knowing I had a destination at the end of it all. I continued my half-improvised trek, squeezing in as much as I could before settling down.

8. Can you describe your experience meeting old friends and advisors in Christchurch?

Christchurch felt like a return to familiar ground. Meeting up with old friends and advisors was both comforting and nostalgic. We reminisced about old times, but there was also a sense of growth, of seeing how far we'd all come. It was a brief pause in the whirlwind of my travels, a moment to reflect on the past before moving forward.

9. What was your most memorable moment in Seattle with your roleplaying group friends?

Seattle was all about reconnecting with people who shared a different part of my life. The most memorable moment was probably a long night of roleplaying, where we got lost in a story that felt more real than the city outside. It was a reminder of the power of imagination and how it can bridge the gap between past and present.

10. Why did you choose to travel to Vancouver after Seattle?

Vancouver was close enough to Seattle to make it an easy next stop, and I'd always been intrigued by the city's reputation as a film hub. I wanted to see what it was like in person, to walk through the streets where so many stories had been brought to life on screen.

11. What was your impression of the film studio area in Vancouver?

The film studio area in Vancouver had a certain buzz to it, a sense of creativity in the air. It was interesting to see the contrast between the polished world of film and the gritty reality of the city. It felt like a place where stories were made, but also where the line between fiction and reality could blur.

12. How did you meet the friend from Delaware in Utah?

We had known each other through mutual friends, and Utah became a convenient meeting point during my travels. It was one of those spontaneous decisions—he was passing through, and I was nearby, so we decided to catch up in person rather than just through messages.

13. What was your experience like during your brief return home for the Fourth of July?

Returning home was surreal. It was a brief respite, a chance to reconnect with family and celebrate a familiar holiday. But there was also a feeling of detachment, like I was just passing through. The fireworks were the same as always, but I felt different, like I had changed more than I realized.

14. Why did you decide to travel to South Korea after your visit home?

The IEEE EMBC 2017 conference was the main reason. It was a chance to immerse myself in cutting-edge research and to see a new part of the world. South Korea had always intrigued me, and this was the perfect opportunity to experience it firsthand, blending work and travel in a way that felt natural.

15. What were your thoughts during the flight from Hong Kong to Jeju Island?

I was exhausted but excited. Hong Kong had been a whirlwind, and the night in the terminal left me feeling disoriented. But as the plane descended towards Jeju Island, I felt a surge of anticipation. I was heading to a place I knew little about, but that only added to the thrill. I wondered what I'd find there, what stories the island would reveal.

16. How did you prepare for the IEEE EMBC 2017 conference in Jeju?

Preparation was mostly about making sure my presentation was solid. I spent a lot of time refining my poster, going over my research, and trying to anticipate questions. But there was also a mental preparation, a kind of steeling myself for the intensity of the conference and the interactions that would come with it.

17. What were your first impressions of Jeju Island?

Jeju was a mix of contrasts—stunning natural beauty juxtaposed with a somber history. The lush landscapes and volcanic peaks were awe-inspiring, but there was an undercurrent of something darker, a reminder of the island's past struggles. It was a place that felt alive with stories, both old and new.

18. How did the history of Jeju Island affect your experience there?

The history of the Jeju Uprising added a layer of complexity to my visit. Knowing about the mass graves and the tragic events of the past made me see the island differently. It wasn't just a tourist destination; it was a place with scars, and that history was always in the back of my mind as I explored.

19. Can you describe your stay at the hotel near the convention center in Seogwipo?

The hotel was conveniently located, just a short walk from the convention center, with a stunning view of the ocean. It was a comfortable place to recharge between conference sessions. The mornings were peaceful, with the sound of the waves in the background, a stark contrast to the busy days at the conference.

20. What was it like meeting C-Yoon Kim in person at the conference?

Meeting C-Yoon Kim was a bit of a scramble. We had coordinated his arrival with some urgency since he had another meeting in Seoul. When we finally met, it was a mix of relief and excitement. He was someone I had admired from afar, and getting to discuss our work face-to-face, even briefly, was a highlight of the conference.

21. What challenges did you face while presenting your poster at the conference?

The biggest challenge was the scrutiny. Presenting a poster at a conference like IEEE EMBC meant standing in front of it for hours, fielding questions and sometimes skepticism from peers. I had to be on my toes, ready to defend my research and explain my methods. There were moments of doubt, especially when someone would give me an odd look, but overall it was a rewarding experience.

22. How did you feel about the brevity of the conference in Jeju?

It was intense but fulfilling. The short duration meant that everything was compressed—sessions, networking, even downtime. It forced me to make the most of every moment, but it also left me wishing there was more time to explore the island and delve deeper into the research being presented.

23. What were your expectations before arriving in Singapore for your new job?

I expected a challenge. I knew Singapore was a fast-paced, competitive environment, and I was ready to dive into that. But I also expected a certain level of comfort—a stable job, a decent place to live. I wasn't prepared for the reality of what awaited me, especially in terms of living conditions.

24. How did you find the hostel in Singapore where you initially stayed?

I found it online, and it seemed like a reasonable option at the time. The reality was a far cry from what I had imagined. The hostel was tucked away in a vacant lot, surrounded by larger buildings, and the conditions were rough. It was a place of survival more than comfort, and I quickly realized it would be a temporary stop, not a long-term solution.

25. What was your reaction to the conditions at the hostel?

Shock, initially. The metal shacks, the rats, the communal spaces—it was a stark contrast to what I was used to. But I tried to take it in stride, reminding myself that it was part of the experience, part of living in a new country. It was uncomfortable, yes, but it also made me appreciate the small comforts I had taken for granted before.

26. How did you cope with the challenges of living in such a hostel?

I focused on the positives—the fact that I was in Singapore, starting a new chapter in my life. I spent as little time as possible in the hostel, exploring the city and immersing myself in the culture. When I was there, I tried to stay busy, whether it was by working, reading, or just planning my next move. It wasn't easy, but I kept reminding myself that it was temporary.

27. What was your first day of work like at the Singaporean company?

It was eye-opening. The company was a collection of small startups, all crammed into a converted industrial park. The atmosphere was hectic, with long hours and a lot of pressure. It wasn't what I expected, but I quickly realized that this was the reality of working in a startup ecosystem. It was sink or swim, and I had to adapt fast.

28. How did you adapt to the culture and work environment in Singapore?

I had to learn quickly. The work culture in Singapore was different from what I was used to—faster, more intense. I embraced the challenge, taking cues from my coworkers and trying to blend in as much as possible. I found solace in the small things, like the food at the hawker center, and gradually adjusted to the pace of life in Singapore.

29. What did you enjoy most about the hawker center near your workplace?

The sheer variety of food was incredible. Every day, I could try something new, something different. The flavors, the spices, the freshness of the ingredients—it was all so different from what I was used to. The hawker center became a kind of refuge, a place where I could unwind and enjoy a good meal after a long day.

30. How did you feel about the low wages and long hours in Singapore?

It was a trade-off. The wages were lower than what I would have expected in the US, and the hours were longer, but it was the price of living and working in a place like Singapore. The experience, the opportunities, and the chance to live in such a dynamic city made it worth it, at least for a time.

31. Can you describe the nightmares you had while staying at the hostel?

The nightmares were a mix of anxiety and the harsh reality of my living situation. I'd dream of rats crawling through the washing machine or the roof caving in on the metal shack. Sometimes it was more abstract—feelings of being trapped or suffocated. Waking up in that environment didn't do much to dispel the unease, but I tried to push through it.

32. How did you manage to find better accommodation in Singapore?

After a few months of toughing it out, I decided enough was enough. I started looking for a room in a condo, something more stable and comfortable. It took some time, but I eventually found a place near Jurong East. It wasn't luxurious, but it was clean, had a functional washing machine, and was conveniently located near the MRT station. It felt like a major upgrade.

33. What were your thoughts on the high turnover rate at your workplace?

The high turnover was unsettling at first, a constant reminder of how precarious the situation was. But it also made me more determined to prove myself, to be one of the ones who stuck around. It was a tough environment, but I saw it as a challenge—a test of my resilience and adaptability.

34. How did you handle being let go after the investor pulled out?

It was a blow, no doubt about it. But I didn't have much time to dwell on it. I knew I had to act fast if I wanted to stay in Singapore. I threw myself into job applications, handed out resumes in person, and networked like crazy. It was a stressful time, but I knew that giving up wasn't an option.

35. What was your strategy for finding new employment in Singapore?

I went old-school. After a few weeks of fruitless online applications, I started physically handing out my resume at companies around one-north, Singapore's tech hub. I'd knock on doors, introduce myself, and leave a resume with anyone who would take it. It was exhausting, but it eventually paid off.

36. How did your living conditions improve after moving to the condo near Jurong East?

It was like night and day. The condo near Jurong East was clean, modern, and much more comfortable than the hostel. I had my own space, access to a gym and a pool, and, most importantly, a fully functional washing machine. It wasn't luxurious, but it felt like a huge step up from where I had been.

37. What was your experience handing out physical copies of your resume in one-north?

It was a bit like guerrilla warfare—knocking on doors, slipping resumes under them, and hoping someone would take notice. It was tiring and sometimes demoralizing, especially when I'd get blank stares or curt rejections. But it was also exhilarating in a way, knowing that I was taking control of my situation and doing everything I could to make something happen.

38. How did you feel when the boss called you in for an interview after sliding your resume under the door?

It felt like a scene out of a movie. I was just about to leave when I heard someone running up behind me. When the guy said the boss wanted to see me, it felt like all my effort had finally paid off. The interview itself was nerve-wracking, but I was ready. I had nothing to lose, and that gave me the confidence to go in and make my case.

39. What was your impression of the engineering manager who became your good friend?

He was sharp, no-nonsense, and clearly passionate about his work. But there was also a warmth to him, a willingness to mentor and help others. We hit it off quickly, and he became a kind of anchor for me in a chaotic environment. He was someone I could trust, and that made all the difference.

40. How did you react to getting a job offer at Innosparks?

Relief and excitement. After everything I'd been through, it felt like a victory. Innosparks was an interesting place—an offshoot of ST Engineering, focused on innovation. It felt like the right fit, a place where I could contribute and grow. I accepted the offer without hesitation.

41. What were your plans after securing the job at Innosparks?

My first plan was to stabilize—settle into the new job, get comfortable in my new living situation, and build some routine. But I also knew that I wasn't done exploring. The job didn't start until January 2018, so I decided to take one last trip before fully committing to the new chapter in Singapore.

42. Why did you decide to visit a friend in rural New Zealand before starting your new job?

I had been invited to help with a unique project—preserving decommissioned percussion pistols from the New Zealand Land Wars. It was a chance to combine my love for history with a bit of adventure. Plus, I had the time before my new job started, so it seemed like the perfect opportunity to do something meaningful and different.

43. Can you describe the project you were involved in preserving decommissioned percussion pistols?

The project was about systematically preserving these historical pistols, which were held by a collector. We were trying to trace their origins and ensure they were documented properly. It involved a lot of hands-on work—inspecting the pistols, researching their history, and figuring out the best ways to preserve them. It was a fascinating dive into a piece of history that not many people knew about.

44. What challenges did you face while traveling to inspect the pistols in New Zealand?

The biggest challenge was the isolation. The place I was staying was over an hour's drive from the nearest town, and the roads were rough. It was also a bit unsettling to be in such a remote area, where the weather could change in an instant, and there wasn't much in the way of modern conveniences. But that was part of the appeal, too—it felt like a true adventure.

45. How did you plan your journey from Auckland to King Country?

The journey from Auckland to King Country was a long bus ride through some of the most stunning landscapes I'd ever seen. I planned it carefully, making sure I had everything I needed for the stay in such a remote area. The route took me through places that felt almost untouched by time, which only added to the sense of anticipation.

46. What were your impressions of King Country and its history?

King Country was rugged, isolated, and full of history. It had a sense of mystery about it, a feeling that the land itself held stories. The connection to the Maori King movement made it even more intriguing—a place that had once been a sanctuary for those resisting colonization. The hills and valleys seemed to echo with the past, making it a place that felt both powerful and poignant.

47. How did the terrain and isolation of King Country affect your experience there?

The terrain was challenging, with steep hills and rough roads, and the isolation was palpable. It made everything feel more intense—every interaction, every moment of quiet. The isolation also forced me to confront myself, to think deeply about what I was doing and why. It was an experience that stripped away the distractions of modern life and left me with a raw, unfiltered connection to the land and its history.

48. What was life like on the remote farm where you stayed?

Life on the farm was simple, quiet, and a bit harsh. It was over an hour's drive from the nearest town, with basic amenities and not much in the way of entertainment. But that simplicity was also its charm. The days were spent working on the pistols, exploring the surrounding area, and reflecting on everything I had seen and done over the past year. It was a chance to slow down and focus on something tangible.

49. How did you adjust to the crime and poverty in King Country?

The crime and poverty were hard to ignore, but they were part of the reality of the place. It was a stark contrast to the landscapes, which were beautiful but often masked the struggles of the people who lived there. I tried to stay aware of my surroundings, to be cautious, but also to be respectful of the community and its challenges. It wasn't easy, but it was a reminder that every place has its own complexities.

50. What were your most restless moments during your stay on the farm?

The restlessness came from the isolation and the quiet. There were moments when I felt cut off from the world, when the silence was almost too much to bear. But I tried to channel that restlessness into my work on the pistols, using it as a way to stay focused and grounded. There were also moments when the history of the place weighed heavily on me, adding to the sense of unease.

51. How did your travels in 2017 impact your personal growth?

The travels in 2017 were transformative. They pushed me to confront my fears, to adapt to new situations, and to learn from every experience. I grew more confident, more resilient, and more open to the world around me. The challenges and the uncertainties taught me to trust myself and to embrace the unknown.

52. What lessons did you learn from your experience with various cultures?

I learned that every culture has its own unique rhythm, its own way of seeing the world. I also learned the importance of listening, of being open to new perspectives and ways of life. The more I traveled, the more I realized how much there is to learn from other cultures, and how those lessons can broaden your understanding of yourself and the world.

53. How did you maintain your mental and physical health during your travels?

It wasn't always easy, but I tried to stay active—walking, hiking, exploring new places. I also made an effort to eat well, even if it meant trying unfamiliar foods. Mentally, I kept a journal, which helped me process everything I was experiencing. There were tough moments, but I tried to stay positive and focused on the bigger picture.

54. What were the biggest surprises you encountered on your journey?

The biggest surprises were the connections I made with people along the way. Whether it was a random encounter in a hostel or a deep conversation with a fellow traveler, these moments of human connection were the most unexpected and rewarding. They reminded me that, no matter how far you go, it's the people you meet who make the journey worthwhile.

55. How did you stay connected with family and friends while traveling?

I relied heavily on technology—emails, social media, video calls. It wasn't the same as being there in person, but it helped bridge the distance. I also sent postcards and letters when I could, a more personal touch that felt meaningful. Staying connected was important, even when I was thousands of miles away.

56. What was your approach to packing and preparing for each new destination?

I tried to keep things light, packing only what I really needed. Flexibility was key—I had to be ready to adapt to different climates, cultures, and situations. My laptop was essential for work and staying connected, but I also carried a few books and a journal to keep myself grounded. Each destination required its own adjustments, but the goal was always to be as prepared as possible without being weighed down.

57. How did you manage your finances while traveling and job hunting?

Carefully. I kept a close eye on my budget, prioritizing essential expenses like accommodation and transportation. I looked for deals, used public transportation, and stayed in hostels to keep costs down. The job offer in Singapore was a financial safety net, but until then, I had to be frugal and make every dollar count.

58. What were the most challenging aspects of transitioning from travel to work?

The biggest challenge was shifting from the freedom of travel to the structure of a work environment. Travel had been about exploration and discovery, while work required focus and routine. It took time to adjust to the demands of a job, especially in a high-pressure startup. Balancing the need for stability with my desire to keep exploring was a constant struggle.

59. How did you navigate language barriers in different countries?

I relied on a mix of basic language skills, translation apps, and body language. In most places, people were understanding and patient, even if we didn't speak the same language. I also made an effort to learn a few key phrases in each language, which helped with everyday interactions. The language barrier was a challenge, but it was also part of the adventure.

60. What were your strategies for staying safe in unfamiliar places?

I tried to stay aware of my surroundings, trust my instincts, and avoid risky situations. I also made sure to research each destination ahead of time, so I knew what to expect and what precautions to take. Traveling alone meant being extra cautious, but it also meant being more in tune with my environment and the people around me.

61. How did you handle cultural differences in the countries you visited?

With respect and curiosity. I made a conscious effort to observe and adapt to the cultural norms of each place I visited. Sometimes it meant adjusting my behavior, like being more reserved in certain situations, or learning the local customs around food and social interactions. It wasn't always easy, but it was important to me to be a respectful and considerate traveler.

62. What role did technology play in facilitating your travels and job search?

Technology was a lifeline. It helped me stay connected with family and friends, navigate unfamiliar places, and apply for jobs remotely. My laptop and phone were essential tools for both work and travel, allowing me to balance the two in a way that wouldn't have been possible otherwise. It made the world feel smaller and more accessible, even when I was far from home.

63. How did you document your travels and experiences during this period?

I kept a detailed journal, writing down my thoughts, experiences, and observations every day. I also took photos, though I tried to focus more on the moments than just capturing images. Sometimes, I'd sketch something that caught my eye or record audio notes to remember a particular sound or conversation. The goal was to create a personal record of the journey, something I could look back on and relive.

64. What were your expectations for the job in Singapore, and how did reality compare?

I expected a challenging but rewarding experience—a chance to grow professionally in a vibrant city. The reality was more intense than I anticipated, with long hours and high expectations. The living conditions were a shock, but they also pushed me to adapt and find solutions. In the end, the job was everything I had hoped for in terms of growth, but it came with challenges I hadn't fully prepared for.

65. How did your previous work experiences influence your approach to job hunting?

My past work experiences taught me the importance of persistence and adaptability. I knew that finding the right job was often a matter of timing and being in the right place, so I approached the job hunt with patience and determination. I also relied on my network and the skills I had developed in previous roles, knowing that they would help me stand out in a competitive market.

66. What was the most difficult decision you had to make during your travels?

The most difficult decision was whether to keep traveling or to settle down when I got the job offer in Singapore. I loved the freedom of travel, but I knew I needed stability and a sense of purpose. Deciding to stay in Singapore meant putting down roots, at least for a while, which was both exciting and daunting.

67. How did you deal with the uncertainty of not having stable employment?

It was stressful, but I tried to focus on what I could control—applying for jobs, networking, and staying positive. I also reminded myself that uncertainty was part of the journey, part of the adventure I had chosen. I used the time to explore, learn, and grow, knowing that something would eventually come through.

68. What were your thoughts on returning home after such an extended period abroad?

Returning home felt strange, like I was stepping into a life that no longer fit quite right. I had changed, grown in ways that made the familiar seem different. It was comforting to be with family and friends, but there was also a sense of restlessness, a feeling that I wasn't ready to settle back into the routine I had left behind.

69. How did your experiences in 2017 shape your career aspirations?

The experiences in 2017 broadened my perspective and made me more confident in my abilities. I realized that I wanted a career that offered both challenge and growth, but also the flexibility to explore and learn continuously. The challenges I faced made me more resilient, and the successes gave me a clearer sense of what I wanted in the future.

70. What advice would you give to someone considering a similar journey?

I would say, go for it—but be prepared for the highs and lows. Travel isn't always easy, and there will be moments of doubt and discomfort. But those are the moments that teach you the most. Keep an open mind, be flexible, and embrace the uncertainty. And most importantly, don't be afraid to take risks and follow your curiosity.

71. How did you stay motivated during the lows of your journey?

I reminded myself of why I started the journey in the first place—the desire to learn, to grow, to experience new things. Even during the tough times, I knew that each challenge was an opportunity to learn something new. I also tried to focus on the positives—the people I met, the places I saw, the small victories along the way.

72. What role did luck play in the opportunities you encountered?

Luck played a huge role, but I also believe in making your own luck. Being in the right place at the right time was often key, but I had to put myself in those situations, take risks, and be open to the opportunities that came my way. It was a combination of luck, persistence, and readiness.

73. How did you build and maintain professional relationships while traveling?

I made an effort to stay connected, whether it was through emails, LinkedIn, or occasional calls. I also made sure to network wherever I went, attending conferences, meeting people in my field, and staying engaged with the communities I encountered. Building relationships was about being genuine, showing interest, and staying in touch even when I was on the move.

74. What were your feelings about starting over in a new country multiple times?

Starting over was both exhilarating and exhausting. Each new country offered a fresh start, but it also meant adjusting to new cultures, environments, and expectations. There was a thrill in the unknown, but it also came with a sense of vulnerability. Over time, I learned to embrace the process of starting over, to see it as an opportunity rather than a setback.

75. How did your perception of home change after your travels?

Home became less about a specific place and more about a feeling—a sense of belonging, comfort, and stability. After so much time on the road, I realized that home could be anywhere, as long as I had connections and a sense of purpose. It wasn't tied to a physical location but to the people and experiences that made me feel grounded.

76. What were the most rewarding aspects of your journey?

The most rewarding aspect was the personal growth—the confidence, resilience, and adaptability I developed along the way. I also cherished the connections I made with people from different cultures and backgrounds, the stories I heard, and the lessons I learned. The journey wasn't always easy, but the rewards were far greater than the challenges.

77. How did your experiences influence your views on work-life balance?

My experiences taught me the importance of balance—of finding time for both work and exploration. While I enjoyed the challenges of my career, I also realized that life is about more than just work. Travel reminded me to stay curious, to make time for adventure and personal growth, and to not get too caught up in the grind of daily life.

78. How did you approach learning about the history and culture of each place you visited?

I made a conscious effort to learn as much as I could—through books, museums, conversations with locals, and just paying attention to the world around me. I didn't want to be just a tourist; I wanted to understand the deeper context of each place, its history, its struggles, and its triumphs. It was a way of honoring the places I visited and the people I met.

79. What was the most impactful cultural experience you had during your travels?

One of the most impactful experiences was learning about the history of the Jeju Uprising in South Korea. It added a layer of complexity to my time on the island, making me more aware of the struggles that had shaped the place. It was a reminder that every destination has its own story, and that understanding the past is key to fully appreciating the present.

80. How did you adapt your communication style in different countries?

I tried to be flexible and observant, adjusting my communication style based on the cultural norms of each place. In some countries, I was more reserved, while in others, I was more direct. I also relied on body language and non-verbal cues when language was a barrier. The goal was always to be respectful and to communicate in a way that was appropriate for the context.

81. What were your biggest fears during your travels, and how did you overcome them?

My biggest fears were around safety and the uncertainty of the future—whether I'd find a job, whether I'd be able to sustain myself. I overcame those fears by staying focused on the present, taking things one step at a time, and reminding myself that every challenge was an opportunity to learn. I also leaned on the support of friends and family when things got tough.

82. How did you maintain a sense of normalcy while constantly on the move?

I created routines wherever I could—whether it was a morning walk, a regular time to write in my journal, or a consistent way of organizing my belongings. These small rituals helped me stay grounded, even when everything around me was changing. They were my way of bringing a sense of stability to an otherwise unpredictable life.

83. What was the most unexpected encounter you had during your journey?

One of the most unexpected encounters was the chess game I played with a Turkish guy in the Singapore hostel. We didn't speak the same language, but through the game, we communicated in a way that went beyond words. It was a brief moment of connection, but it left a lasting impression.

84. How did your understanding of global politics change as a result of your travels?

Travel made me more aware of the complexities of global politics—the way history, culture, and power dynamics intersect in different parts of the world. It was easy to see the world in black and white before I left, but after visiting so many places and hearing so many perspectives, I realized how nuanced everything is. It made me more empathetic and more critical of oversimplified narratives.

85. What were the key differences between the work cultures in the countries you visited?

The work culture in Singapore was fast-paced, competitive, and efficiency-driven, with long hours and high expectations. In contrast, New Zealand had a more laid-back approach, with a greater emphasis on work-life balance. Each place had its own rhythm, and adapting to these different cultures required flexibility and a willingness to learn.

86. How did you handle homesickness or feelings of isolation during your travels?

I stayed connected with family and friends through video calls and social media, which helped bridge the distance. I also made an effort to meet new people and immerse myself in the local culture, which helped ease the feelings of isolation. Writing in my journal was another way of processing those emotions and staying grounded.

87. What were the most significant challenges in building a new life in Singapore?

The biggest challenges were adapting to the pace of life and finding stable accommodation. The work environment was demanding, and the living conditions were tough at first. It took time to adjust, but once I found a better place to live and got into the rhythm of work, things started to fall into place.

88. How did your travels influence your long-term goals?

Travel opened my eyes to the possibilities of living and working in different parts of the world. It made me realize that I didn't have to follow a traditional path, that I could combine my love for travel with my career. My long-term goals became less about settling down in one place and more about finding ways to integrate exploration and growth into every aspect of my life.

89. What role did spontaneity play in your travel plans?

Spontaneity played a huge role. While I had certain destinations in mind, many of my best experiences came from last-minute decisions—like hopping on a train to Vancouver or deciding to visit a friend in rural New Zealand. Being open to the unexpected allowed me to have experiences I never would have planned for.

90. How did your experiences challenge your preconceived notions about the world?

Travel shattered a lot of my preconceived notions. I realized that the world is far more complex and diverse than I had imagined, and that no single narrative or perspective can capture the full truth of any place or culture. It was humbling, and it made me more open to different ways of thinking and living.

91. How did you balance the excitement of new experiences with the need for stability?

It was a constant balancing act. On one hand, I craved the excitement of new experiences and the freedom of travel. On the other hand, I knew I needed stability—both financially and emotionally. I tried to create structure where I could, but I also embraced the uncertainty, trusting that things would work out in the end.

92. What was your biggest takeaway from the IEEE EMBC 2017 conference?

The biggest takeaway was the importance of networking and making connections. The conference itself was brief, but the relationships I built there—particularly with C-Yoon Kim—were invaluable. It reinforced the idea that professional growth is as much about who you know as it is about what you know.

93. How did your travels impact your personal relationships?

Travel put a strain on some relationships, but it also strengthened others. Being away for long periods of time made it harder to stay connected with certain people, but the friends and family who supported me throughout the journey became even more important. The distance helped me appreciate those relationships in a new way.

94. What was the most difficult goodbye you had to say during your travels?

The hardest goodbye was leaving New Zealand after working on the percussion pistols project. I had formed a deep connection with the place and the people involved in the project. Saying goodbye felt like closing a chapter on an experience that had been both challenging and deeply rewarding.

95. How did your experiences abroad influence your sense of identity?

Travel expanded my sense of identity, making me realize that I wasn't defined by one place or culture. I became more comfortable with the idea of being a global citizen, someone who belongs to many places but isn't tied to any one of them. It gave me a sense of freedom, but also a deeper appreciation for the places I call home.

96. What were the most meaningful connections you made during your journey?

The most meaningful connections were often the ones I didn't expect—the Turkish chess player, the engineering manager who became my friend, the fellow travelers who shared a moment of understanding. These connections reminded me that, no matter where you are, there's always the possibility of forming deep, lasting relationships.

97. How did you stay resilient in the face of adversity during your travels?

I stayed resilient by focusing on the bigger picture, reminding myself that every challenge was temporary and that I was on a journey of growth. I also leaned on the support of the people I met along the way and stayed grounded through journaling and reflection. Each setback was a chance to learn and grow stronger.

98. What were your thoughts on returning to a more stable lifestyle after your journey?

Returning to stability was both comforting and a bit unsettling. After so much time on the road, the idea of settling down felt strange. But I also craved a sense of routine and purpose. It was a time of reflection, of figuring out how to integrate the lessons of my travels into a more stable life without losing the sense of adventure.

99. How did you reconcile the highs and lows of your experiences in 2017?

I saw the highs and lows as two sides of the same coin. The highs wouldn't have been as meaningful without the lows, and the challenges made the successes even more rewarding. I learned to embrace both, understanding that the full spectrum of experiences was what made the journey so impactful.

100. What are your reflections on the overall impact of this travel period on your life?

This period of travel fundamentally changed me. It expanded my horizons, taught me resilience, and deepened my understanding of the world. It was a time of intense personal growth, filled with challenges and rewards. Looking back, I wouldn't change a thing—it was a journey that shaped who I am today and set the course for everything that followed.

To my lovely fiancé Huoy Jing, my muse and personal pillar. You endure like a persistent catalyst, and you are brighter than an intense exothermic reaction. 
“If knowledge can create problems, it is not through ignorance that we can solve them.” 
—Isaac Asimov
Beyond Comfort
My family was content in comfort and convention, but that was not for me. I grew up as a statistical abnormality, even by the standards of my era and demographic. I was the firstborn in a stable nuclear family in the United States in the late 20th century. Unlike many of my peers, my parents never separated, divorced, or moved during my childhood. My father was a civil engineer, and I was sent mostly to Catholic schools. My dad’s stable job and my private education served to mark us as solidly upper middle-class, a pathway to a professional life. I knew both sets of grandparents, and I was always curious about what lay beyond. I had to discover those answers myself.
As a kid, I admired those who faced danger and peril for the sake of knowledge. What use was knowledge if it was given unopposed? What use was there in only accepting the truths provided by established authorities? Those willing and able to stand against the grain, both real and fictional, were my heroes. My two favorite fictional role models were Indiana Jones and Alan Grant of Jurassic Park. I proudly dressed as each for Halloween, but few of my peers recognized the characters. This was the first time I faced a recurring problem: unfamiliarity with worlds beyond one’s own peer group. As I came to learn, that was a universal problem across the world.
Anthropologist Robin Dunbar noted that one could maintain relationships with about 150 people, a value known as the Dunbar number. He proposed this was the approximate size of early human bands in the prehistoric era. Statistically, most people reach this number with those they grow up with, those they went to school with, those they work with, and their immediate family. Those who move or travel frequently have more flexible social circles, but the number remains constant. This is also around the same size as a company in the military, reflecting the upper limit of individuals an officer might directly know. It is also the size of many small and medium businesses, where scaling up can adversely affect the core organization. It’s a number I had to pay attention to.
I’ve had the privilege of living, working, teaching, and studying in four countries across three continents. I’ve lived in the United States, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea. Before each move, I researched as thoroughly as I could to better understand local history and how it had led to the current status quo. While all politics are local, there were alarming trends around the world. My primary worry became the consolidation of wealth, power, and authority among those who created the problems in the first place. Awareness of local political contexts helped highlight why those problems exist. At a time when more people were falling through the cracks and old grudges were being unearthed, it was a bad time to be an optimist. So how did I do it?
By ignoring those who said I could not. Those who disparaged my ideas were not just small-minded strangers, but many of the people I grew up with. My original Dunbar number was a prison of personal relationships, but I turned it into a springboard. I found support in unexpected places and from unexpected people. I’ve endured hardships in foreign countries, at one point even being forced to dumpster dive to survive. I’ve stayed in dormitories with migrant workers and students from the poorest places on Earth. I’ve traveled to dangerous places and even almost died a few times. In retrospect, it was worth it. 
I’ve been a Stoic my entire life. To Marcus Aurelius, the obstacle was the path. To Teddy Roosevelt, voluntary hardship improved character. In the end, it is the fighter in the arena that matters, not the caustic critics. To Miyamoto Musashi, self-discipline was the greatest strength. My personal pantheon of heroes expanded to include an eclectic bunch: Ida B. Wells, courageous journalist and writer; Admiral Hyman Rickover, father of the nuclear US Navy; Dr. Richard Feynman, renegade and skeptical physicist; Yi Sun-shin, the innovative and courageous admiral who saved Joseon Korea; Heron of Alexandria, inventor of the first steam engine; Lee Kuan Yew, founder of modern Singapore; Marcus Porcius Cato, the Stoic senator that stood against Julius Caesar; Te Ruki Kawiti, the Maori master of fortification; A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, father of the Indian space program; and Su Song, the prolific polymath of Song dynasty China. I plan to detail why each resonated with me at different points in my life. 
Many of those names may be unfamiliar to you, but I suggest reading about them all. I respect intellect, innovation, courage, exploration, and polymathy. Not everyone can balance multiple fields, but I greatly respect those who do. Even without being born into wealth, discipline and determination can be deciding factors. While there are factors we cannot control, we should prioritize self-control first and foremost. Even if we are born into comfort, we cannot depend on remaining there. Even if we are born into hardship, this may change due to external occurrences. In either case, we must remain open to new possibilities.
In the spring of 2021, a string of personal disasters sent me from sunny Singapore to my parents’ house in New Jersey. Fortune forced me back to the place I had spent my life trying to escape. This was not the first time this happened, but it was the most crushing. The first time was in 2015, when I returned from grad school in New Zealand to find only my undergraduate student loans waiting for me. This time, in 2021, I’d almost died abroad in December, been separated from my fiancé in Singapore at a trying time, and been unable to continue several projects of immense personal importance. What saddened me most, though, was what did not change at home.
In elementary school, I remember being yelled at by someone I had known growing up, someone I admired and wanted to be like. This was someone who shouted that I was not as smart as they were. I returned to find this individual a sad shell of how I remembered them. Instead of expanding their intellect, they sat in front of the television, watching only cable news and becoming an apologist for a political party that threw them overboard four decades ago. Instead of improving and broadening their dietary habits, they poisoned their body with alcohol and refused to try new things. I had hoped for better, but that hope was stubbornly rebuffed. To paraphrase William Blake, I expected only poison from standing water. 
The sad thing is that such cases are not uncommon, regardless of birthplace, political platform, social class, or profession. Perhaps it is the curse of complacence and comfort, but smug stagnation is the road to decay. I have accomplished many things that I am proud of: the first forensic technique specifically for 3D-printed guns; the first artificial cyborg body with integrated life support; a new type of artificial lung for life support; the first English-language weird fiction magazine for Southeast Asian writers; the first systematic reverse-engineering of New Zealand Maori Land Wars militaria; the first low-cost orbital debris removal system for developing countries; and proposals for decentralized atmospheric capture fuel generation for low-cost relativistic spacecraft, technological telepathy, and others. Despite this, some people will never be impressed. Some are content to sit and complain as the world moves on. 
That is not a fate I ever want to suffer. Many of my peers settled into the patterns of their parents and predecessors. The inventions I describe are not only possible but, in many cases, have been proven in labs for decades. Their implications and applications promise far more than most can comprehend. I have paid with my own savings, my own wages, and my own future to bring them into existence. I traded a conventional life for grasps of ever-evasive inventions. Unlike many of my peers, I believe in a better tomorrow. I will not succumb to their cynicism. I do not have a career, house, or family like they do. Perhaps there is a reason for that. 
I was born in 1986, the Year of the Tiger in the Chinese Zodiac. Folklore holds that tigers are adventurous, brash, and bold. I’ve certainly lived up to that as best as I can. I am not one to take the easy path, and I would do everything over again. I do not forget those who helped me, and I regret that I could not help them more. However, there are times when an individual must initialize projects, oversee them, and ensure they reach fruition. A lone wolf is easy prey, a straggler killed by rival packs. A tiger, however, is built to hunt alone. I tell my story with the hope it might inspire someone looking for a reason to keep going. I’ve taken some creative license to protect a few names and personal details. No matter where we are, we must hold ourselves up before we help others. 
Because in the jungle, the tiger hunts alone. 
Building Steam
I grew up in the Pax Americana, as I believe future historians will define it. I did not know much of why the world was the way it was, but I was always curious. Shortly before I was born, my country suffered a space-related tragedy. About a month before my birthday, the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded, which caused Richard Feynman to submit his report blaming NASA administration for the disaster. I was ignorant of the whole affair, but I did not know the magnitude of what transpired around me. 
In my first years, major changes occurred around the world: dirty wars continued in Latin America, the Soviet Union crumbled, the First Gulf War ended with an overwhelming American victory, and Japan suffered a catastrophic economic crash. These events set the stage for a decade in which the United States seemed to be the epitome of existence, the end of history, as Francis Fukuyama complained. Many thought that political arrangement would endure longer than it did, but I grew up without such expectations.
I vaguely remember my little brother and sister’s births. My memories of this time include a walk on a railroad bridge near the hospital. I was unaware of the broader politics of the era, but I was always curious about where I was. When I was an infant, my mother said I would stack up my toys and climb out of the playpen to explore the house. That might have been the beginning of a talent for improvisation. This talent served me well, and I was always eager to learn about how the world around me came to be.
Among other television shows, I watched a science show called Beakman’s World, whose titular scientist was played by Paul Zaloom. I liked it more than Bill Nye since it seemed more colorful and vibrant. I am primarily a visual learner, and I still think of Beakman’s World’s props and experiments. I began drawing concepts and characters in my brainstorming, although these drawings were uniformly awful enough to be modern art.
Like many kids my age, I watched my share of cartoons. These ranged from the awful Beetlejuice cartoon to the excellent Batman animated series. I’d often have my own ideas for fictional worlds, beings, and machinery and for how these worlds might function. While I was not yet fully into creative writing and worldbuilding, I started here. After receiving a Sega Genesis for Christmas one year, I added video games to my life.
This device opened up the world of video games to me. Like many units sold in America at the time, a Sonic the Hedgehog 2 cartridge was included. The game was fast, frantic, and simple. This remained the stereotype of this emerging media form for my parents and peers, although I wanted something more complex and interesting. I always loved to dive into the details, much to my teachers’ annoyance. 
My parents sent me to Catholic school starting in first grade. I began at Saint Agnes knowing only a neighbor in the eighth grade, and I left without knowing a single person in my class. However, as I was confronted by the terms used by the Roman Catholic Church, I set about familiarizing myself with them. This led me to read about Roman history and the classical antiquity that preceded it. 
It was during this time that I heard of the first steam engine, the aeolipile, invented by Heron of Alexandria, on Beakman’s World. I also read about the Antikythera Mechanism, an early clockwork computer dating to the Roman era. The idea that technology could be lost or rediscovered from antiquity stuck with me for the rest of my life. Reading about ancient Egypt and watching Raiders of the Lost Ark were the impetus behind my first fictional hero:  Indiana Jones. 
Another media franchise snagged my young interest at the time: Jurassic Park. The premise of modern technology bringing ancient beasts back to life made dinosaurs all the more appealing to me; I suppose many children felt the same. To me, Jurassic Park was a natural thematic complement to Indiana Jones, sharing the premise that things lost to the ages could be rediscovered to great effect in the present. Alan Grant, the paleontologist protagonist of Jurassic Park, seemed just the sort of canny, resourceful person I wanted to be. To this day, one of my favorite ideas is that we must study the past to save the future, not merely to avoid the mistakes of prior generations but to expand and build upon what they could not.
I began to watch the X-Files toward the middle of the 90s. Mulder and Scully’s weekly mysteries were enough to make me want to be an FBI agent, although I had little idea of what a special agent actually did. In keeping with the show’s themes of conspiracy and urban legends, I immersed myself in books on UFOs, ghosts, and similar Forteana. Even to my young mind, the fact that such things could not be proven was a subtle turn off, so I turned once more to the world around me.
I came to understand history in a cyclical way, as a series of rising and falling between peaks of civilization. The highs of Alexandrine Egypt were lost until the Renaissance, which eventually led to the Industrial Revolution, where steam power finally got its due. Reading about steam power sparked my interest in trains and railroads, especially steam trains. Throughout my childhood, rarely a birthday or Christmas passed without another toy train making its way into my possession. 
I focused obsessively on railroads, in addition to dinosaurs and other interests of the moment. However, I was always curious about what lay beyond the planet. I read extensively about black holes since they seemed key to many UFO conspiracy theories. The books I encountered at the public library were simplified for someone of my age group, but I devoured them nevertheless. 
I had some curiosity about society and why people treated each other the way they did. I remember acquiring a sociology textbook at a used book sale. The book was heavy reading for an elementary school student, but I followed it as best I could. Like many of the things I exposed myself to, I moved outside of my parents’ comfort zone. Few of my peers shared my interest, and I had little interest in theirs. I talked with older neighbors and grandparents, whose stories were far more interesting than the comfortable upbringing of my Boomer parents. It was my grandparents’ lives I most frequently measured my own against. 
I tried my share of other activities. I joined Cub Scouts and later, Boy Scouts. However, most of the kids there attended the local public schools instead of my Catholic school, so I scarcely saw them outside of Scouts. I was an altar boy at the local Catholic Church, much to the chagrin of my later agnostic self. I played chess with my dad and a few others, but I never dove deeply into it. My family upgraded the Genesis to a PlayStation, on which I played Tomb Raider and Final Fantasy VII. Once we got a PC, I explored games for it. As I finished eighth grade and transitioned to high school, I was an introvert and obsessive gamer. 
That would not change for another decade. I’d hyped myself up on a trajectory I thought would define my life for years to come, building steam like a mighty locomotive. Like many teenagers, I would be struck by a raft of realities that sent my life plans off course. In retrospect, I believe I’ve turned out far better because of it. Otherwise, I might’ve had a more standard life. Even as a teenager, I did not want to be a number. I wanted to be a vector. 
I had to learn how to reach ramming speed. 

Behind the End of History
As I grew up, I sought to understand the world beyond my own life. Many of my peers erroneously believe the 1990s to be a peaceful, triumphant period. That may have been the case in the United States. and Europe, but it was not universal. The brutal Yugoslav Wars were underway, eventually warranting NATO intervention. Various border disputes across the world escalated into conventional conflicts, such as those between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and Armenia and Azerbaijan. A host of post-Soviet conflicts flared up across Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Needless to say, these events set the stage for history’s “resumption” at the decade’s end. 
I would like to highlight how domestic politics in Anglophone countries set the stage for the spread of disaster capitalism—the neoliberalism of human misery—around the world. In her 2007 book “The Shock Doctrine,” Naomi Klein documented the political strategy of tension used in former communist countries in the 90s. This would parallel the political changes occurring within the US, UK, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and elsewhere. Such changes were remote to much of my life, save when those on the periphery of my middle-class life suffered from it. 
This political debacle was primarily enabled by the election of Bill Clinton as US President. While George Bush Sr. had his flaws, he was at least competent in realpolitik. In his autobiography, for instance, he claimed that he did not depose Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein after the First Gulf War because it would have created an unwinnable guerrilla war. His son later proved this exact point, but I digress. I would like to focus on what happened around the collapse of the Soviet Union. What happened there would mirror my own country’s future in more ways than one. 
I’d like to draw your attention to the immediate aftermath of German reunification. Bush Sr. told Soviet leader Gorbachev that NATO would not expand one inch further to the east. As the former head of the CIA, Bush was more than aware of how the Russians would interpret the hostility of continuous NATO expansion into former Warsaw Pact countries. According to Prof. Stephen Cohen of Princeton, the Russians preferred to have buffer states between themselves and Western Europe. In my younger years, I barely knew of the politics, save wars and events on the nightly cable news my parents religiously watched. 
Bush likely did not halt the expansion of NATO out of goodwill, but out of the knowledge that it would increase tensions without clear gain. His strategy was likely to gradually invest and liberalize the former Soviet countries and perhaps integrate them into NATO in time. This plan, under Bush Sr., would likely include Russia itself. Little did I know how this would play out in later decades. 
As a child, I was only vaguely aware of Russia and China as geopolitical adversaries, but I’d heard how the world was shrinking. This was because, at the time, American dominance of Eurasia was a key consideration. Henry Kissinger played China against Russia, and Bush Sr. might have wanted to play Russia against China. While China was not yet the powerhouse it is today, it was rapidly modernizing. Such a strategy would have been akin to contemporary China’s Belt and Road Initiative, with the US integrating Eurasia according to its own interests. 
That is not what the incoming Clinton administration did. Just as Bill Clinton threw the US poor under the bus, so too did he advocate for similar policies abroad. Under the Clinton administration, 13 million Americans were thrown off welfare. I recall talking with a classmate in elementary school whose relative was forced to live in a car and thinking it was peculiar and ignorant of the hardship this policy entailed. Cruel policies followed in John Howard’s Australia, Tony Blair’s Britain, Jim Bolger’s New Zealand, and other countries. However, Russia is of particular interest. 
The late Professor Stephen Cohen of Princeton and New York University, a Russian history expert, detailed the aftermath of the Soviet collapse. There was a botched coup by Soviet hardliners, but that was only the beginning. Boris Yeltsin’s privatization of former state assets started with a very different coup and led directly to the deaths of hundreds. This was a body count I only became aware of later. 
Bill Clinton, together with the EU and UK, pushed the rapid privatization of state assets. This turned industries, from energy to armaments, over to local and foreign oligarchs. To these ends, a privatization bill was rushed before the Duma, the Russian Parliament. It was poorly received, to put it mildly. The post-Soviet Russian Supreme Court intervened, but Yeltsin ignored it. He deployed troops to escalate the situation. 
Journalist Mark Ames lived through these events and recounted them on episodes of the excellent Radio War Nerd podcast. Russian Interior Ministry forces, suitably known as OMON in English, were dispatched around Moscow. They opened fire on journalists, foreign expatriates, and crowds of people. Ames estimates that total casualties were over a thousand. He grimly notes that the US, the EU, and Russian elites had an incentive to bury such events since they willingly participated and benefited from them. 
Yeltsin used a textbook strategy of tension, manufacturing a domestic crisis and international confusion to distract from the implementation of unpopular policies. The social safety net fell away, and living standards plummeted. Starvation, homelessness, suicides, depression, and crime drastically increased. The Chechnyan wars raged, leading to apartment bombings near the end of the decade. One of Yeltsin’s security advisors, Vladimir Putin, rose to prominence in Western media. The Anglosphere press happily claimed Putin was “a man they could do business with.” 
What happened in Russia was not unique to Russia. Similar events occurred in former Yugoslavia and across the Warsaw Pact countries. Understandably, many countries had no interest in being Russian client states, since the Communist era was still a living memory for many. Thus, a new wave of nationalistic governments joined NATO, upgrading their militaries to match the alliance’s standards. As NATO expanded, the Russian state grew suspicious once more. They turned their attention eastward, believing they could not trust the West. 
The policies pushed by Clinton left little doubt as to why.
I believe Bush Sr. would have pursued similar ends, but at a slower, more measured pace. While Bush was a grim remnant of the Reagan era, he knew when to restrain political and military force. He was a World War II vet and former head of the CIA, after all. I am too young to remember the Bush Sr. years, so such thoughts are relegated to an alternative history. Instead, we had a generation of political leaders in the US, EU, and Commonwealth that knew neither restraint nor reason, believing themselves the rightful heirs of the world. Were they not the ones who ‘won’ the Cold War and seized the wealth of foreign lands while cutting domestic welfare states? 
It is of note that the former centrist “left” parties, such as the Clinton Democrats and Blairite Labour, were the main actors behind these policies. Clinton gleefully repealed the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated commercial and investment banking. Similar roadblocks against the financialization of the developed world’s economies went down like dominos. The rapacious rulers of this era saw no effective opposition, although that would change. 
The founder of cyberpunk literature, William Gibson, once said the future was already here—it was just not evenly distributed. While I remembered the 90s as a functional decade in the US, it was a dysfunctional disaster in many places around the world. I would experience exactly how dysfunctional over the following decade, starting around the time I started high school. 
The decline was just beginning.
My Source Code
After those grim geopolitics, let’s lighten the mood. I would like to take a moment to reflect on some of the media I grew up with. I was part of the first online generation, and I remember some of what it was like before we were online 24/7. I was fortunate enough to have the chance to explore and experience what media I remembered as a child, and I hope to encourage even a few adults to dive into them.
We watched movies and television series primarily on VHS cassette tapes rented out from local video stores. Similarly, some public libraries lent out videos. CDs existed, but audio cassettes were still commonplace. I once played with a few cheap tape recorders, but these were soon eclipsed by other media.
As a kid, I lived through the console war between the Super Nintendo and the Sega Genesis. My family got a Sega, while my cousin had a Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). I rarely got a chance to use it, so I missed out on the exclusive game titles on the SNES. While I’d heard amazing things about Nintendo’s Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger, I went to far stranger places with the Genesis. 
I played a few standard games like Sonic and Mortal Kombat. During my dinosaur obsession, I threw every Jurassic Park game I could into that console. However, there was one psychedelic game that was stranger than a drug trip: Ecco the Dolphin, along with its sequel, Tides of Tide. The plot involved a time-traveling dolphin battling a biomechanical alien, accompanied by a synthesized soundtrack as eerie and mystical as the 16-bit system could provide. Some of it still creeps me out today.
My family did not get a PC until later in the 90s, right around the time we upgraded to a Sony PlayStation. I became interested in PC gaming just in time for junior high, when I plunged into strategy games, both real-time and turn-based. The first PC strategy game I played was Command and Conquer, itself a reflection of 1990s ideas: the game featured a developed world-backed Global Defense Initiative in an asymmetric war with the shadowy Brotherhood of Nod. I later played Command and Conquer: Red Alert, loving its combination of alternative history with science fiction. Frank Klepacki’s music truly sealed the deal, and I still listen to his tracks today. What truly got me addicted to PC gaming, though, was Sid Meier’s work.
I was introduced to turn-based strategy games with Sid Meier’s Civilization II. The premise was to take turns building a stone-age tribe into a modern superpower. There were two primary ways to win: establishing a space colony or simply conquering everyone. Naturally, I preferred the first option. The games were long but rewarding. 
Being a young competitive preteen, I then leaped into action games that were furious and fun. I played the hell out of a Doom demo disk I had (pun intended). I battled killer mining robots in Descent. I hurled through eras to the Iron Age in Age of Empires. Little did I know that there was a common thread behind these games, a designer whose interests I would come to share. That man was legendary game designer Sandy Peterson, a longtime fan of the Cthulhu mythos. Those games spurred my interest in real life history and tracing the taxonomy of pop culture. 
Civilization had an in-game encyclopedia of all the technologies, units, cultures, and figures in the game. I enjoyed reading it to better understand how the modern world came about. Age of Empires 1 and 2 had thick game manuals that doubled as mini-history books. I recall playing in-game scenarios based loosely on historical battles. One of these sticks out in my mind: the Imjin War scenario, where the player controlled Joseon Korean forces. This was my introduction to the greatest navy commander in history: Admiral Yi Sun-shin.
At the time, I became interested in anime, manga, and Japanese pop culture. I had read about the country’s history and was more than aware of the Japanese Sengoku of warring samurai and daimyo warlords. However, this was my first introduction to the Imjin War, where Hideyoshi launched ill-fated invasions of the Asian mainland through the Korean peninsula. Korea and Ming China were both saved by Yi Sun-shin.
Using Encarta and what research I could conduct, I read about this man, who few of my peers even knew existed. Admiral Yi was not an admiral at first but a border commander on Joseon, Korea’s frigid frontier. When the Japanese invaded, he found himself using the Korean coast to assist a flotilla of increasingly sophisticated warships. He refined (though some believe he invented) the turtle ship, an early ironclad driven by oars. He used them to repel Japanese boarding attempts while rows of cannons unleashed broadsides on enemy fleets. In this way, he independently arrived at a similar tactic to the galleass prototypes used by the Venetians at the Battle of Lepanto. Early Korean naval commanders had been similarly innovative in the preceding centuries, chasing off pirates with early gunpowder weapons. I came to respect this historical figure I’d only read about in secondhand accounts, a man separated from my own life by centuries, cultures, and continents. 
What I admired the most about Admiral Yi was his combination of courage and innovation in saving the day. He was willing to risk himself to save his allies, diving into the thick of enemy fleets and never losing a single ship. Those were traits I aspired to. I also gained an appreciation for Korean history and for exploring stories I did not learn in school. Those indirect accounts of Admiral Yi inspired me to dive into imaginary adventures. At my mom’s behest, I read Temple, a thriller by Matthew Reilly. This got me started reading “adult” novels, including Michael Crichton, James Rollins, Douglass Preston, and Lincoln Child. 
The novels I read shaped my choice of media. I didn’t have internet access at home, so I substituted social interaction with single-player epic games. I explored lost civilizations in Tomb Raider. I battled mad mutants in Parasite Eve. I was awed by the spectacle of Final Fantasy VII. I battled gods and giant robots in Xenogears. However, these PlayStation games were blown away by a single entry on the PC: the spiritual sequel to Civilization II, Sid Meier’s Alpha Centauri. In Civilization II, the science victory involved setting up a colony on Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to our own. 
Alpha Centauri begins when the spaceship arrives, and the crew fractures into different ideological factions. The fictional alien world of the game, Chiron, was exceedingly well-developed. Each faction leader was perfectly written and voiced. Thanks to the references in the game’s encyclopedic manual, I read Frank Herbert’s Dune, Isaac Asimov’s Foundation trilogy, and Arthur C. Clarke’s 2001: A Space Odyssey. 
I eventually ended up playing most of the games I had missed in elementary school. Once my family got a better PC, I played Half-Life and Deus Ex. Chrono Trigger and the SNES-era Final Fantasy games (IV-VI) ended up being ported to the PlayStation. Thanks to my cousin, I also watched Ghost in the Shell and Neon Genesis Evangelion (including End of Evangelion). No matter how impressed I was, though, a far stranger experience waited on the other side of eighth grade: high school.
Then I would put myself to a much harder test. 
High and Low
I arrived at high school like a junk car arriving at a parade: ignobly and awkwardly. I acted cringey and obnoxious enough to make edgelords look like social butterflies. That said, physically, I arrived at freshman year better off than I’d left eighth grade. I’d spent the summer jogging, biking, and trying to improve my diet and habits. I’d lost a good bit of weight, so much that many of my former classmates didn’t recognize me.
Sadly, old habits returned—hard. As classes started and time for carefree exercise decreased, the weight returned. With it came the bad times and bad moods; and being a lapsed Catholic turned agnostic deist, and political skeptic in the middle of a conservative Catholic school only added to it. I did not have the internet, a social life, or many venues for hanging out with people outside of school. I lived a forty-minute bus ride from school, and it would be years before I would be old enough for a learner’s permit.
Thus ended my freshman year. I was isolated, overweight, depressed, and out of shape. I kept writing, but I found very few peers who shared my interests. I was on one of the faster-paced academic tracks at my school, but I was too inexperienced and immature to truly appreciate the good things I had. A silver lining, though, was that at the end of the year, my house finally got internet access.
I went into that summer with an internet connection as fast as my parents’ Windows 98 computer would allow. This was when peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing software was at its peak, and Napster, Kazaa, Limewire, and other virus-filled trashware were nearly ubiquitous. There was a positive outcome to my early internet exploration, however. I discovered many public domain works online, notably those by Howard Phillips Lovecraft. I joined a writing site called FictionPress (then Fanfiction.net), where I quickly connected with others who shared my esoteric interests. I met my first online friends on that site—but things were about to get worse.
September 11, 2001 was a few days into my sophomore year. I had a cousin working in the Twin Towers. Thankfully, he left early that day, ignoring his boss’s insistence that it was safe to go back. The moral I took away from this was that taking a break can save your life, despite what superiors may tell you. The truth is, no leader is prepared for a day like that. Almost.
There was one leader who was prepared: George W. Bush, hand puppet of Dick Cheney. Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, and others in that ghoulish administration were former members of the think tank The Project for a New American Century (PNAC). The gist of the PNAC’s publications advocated using a “new Pearl Harbor” to establish American hegemony in Iraq and the greater Middle East to deter a possible competitor in Eurasia. After 9/11, they put their harebrained plans into action.
Even as a teenager, I was aware of how utterly this event would be milked by politicians and the corporations that sponsored them. The PATRIOT Act, the initial thrust expanding the security and surveillance state, slipped through Congress like a lubricated dildo. Ron Paul was one of the few who opposed it, although that is a story for a different day.
I remember the invasion of Afghanistan in the following months, including a November newscast about some of the first American casualties on the ground. I remember grimly thinking to myself that they would not be the last. At the time, though, I was on board with the war. Osama bin Laden was a rich, spoiled brat from the wretched aristocracy of Saudi Arabia, with whom the Bushes were close friends. The immediate shuttling of bin Laden’s relatives out of the United States after 9/11 was a sign of that friendship.
Toward the winter of 2001, the build-up to the war in Iraq had begun. No-bid contracts went out to Cheney’s Halliburton and other well-connected corporations. I remember the constant news cycle on the non-existent weapons of mass destruction, the token visit by UN inspectors under Hans Blix, and the completely jingoistic atmosphere. I remember growing up in opposition to this very (neo-)conservative, very rigid mindset. I remember that Bush Sr. explicitly mentioned removing Saddam would create a nightmarish power vacuum. Sadly, Bush Jr. demonstrated that he was at the shallow end of the family gene pool. 
Further raising my skepticism of the status quo was how eagerly the Democratic “opposition” cheered the debacle. At the time, it was fashionable among blue staters to support invading Afghanistan but not Iraq. Yellow ribbons and flags hung from cars, houses, and businesses. “Supporting the troops,” regardless of the politics, was a mantra of that era. It still resonates with me since I had friends that joined. I was too young to join at the time, but 9/11 caused enlistment rates to surge. I was (and still am) convinced that Iraq was an endeavor that was rotten to the core, and the failure to stop it helped discredit the “left” party in my eyes. This was not the party I’d heard about in history, but a post-Clinton neoliberal husk of it.
My fixation on politics was abnormal for someone my age. I’d never quite figured out how I was supposed to interact with peers, which stunted my social life in high school. While others talked about sports, dates, and gossip, I was content to isolate myself with the other weirdos. Like the other outsiders in my age group, we found a comfortable niche in video games and anime. I was weird even within the otaku scene because I also dabbled in physics, philosophy, classic sci-fi, military history, and other endeavors. 
I did not particularly care about popularity, even then. One year, I requested an SAT prep book for Christmas. My only goal for high school was to get to college. I took my math and science classes seriously, disdaining the mandatory religious and Spanish classes. While Spanish was a far more useful language than the linguistic dead end that was French, I wanted to learn Japanese or Mandarin. I would have even been content with Latin. 
I took two years of Spanish, and each year had at least one challenging math class. I doubled up on trig and geometry my junior year so that I could take AP Calculus my senior year. Math was especially hard for me, which might surprise many of you. I often used history classes as an opportunity to show off, so much so that the teacher would tell her other class what she learned from me. My teacher for biology and later, AP biology—a retired veterinarian named Dr. R. Simmons—really supported me. He was my favorite teacher, without a doubt. Sadly, I only took his classes my first and last years in high school. 
In the summer before senior year, I completed a few projects. One was completing my first (and worst) novel. Another was taking a basic sociology class at a community college so that it could serve as an elective in university. I also took an elective on HTML and basic web design, which were vital skills in the 2000s. That was a rather simple course, though I still sometimes put those skills to use. 
My senior year involved three AP classes: biology, US history, and calculus. I strove to be the best at biology, prioritizing that class above the others. I took US History on a whim, as it was the only AP history class offered. Calculus was brutal for me, but still very useful. In the end, I studied for the AP biology exam for months, the calculus exam for weeks, and the history exam for minutes. I passed biology and history, but not calculus. Where I was going, I’d have to take biology anyway.
The highlight of my senior year was one of my few outings with friends to see Return of the King, the last in Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy. I saw it with my friend Nate, as well as a few people I knew from elementary school, and a handful of their friends. Unlike my peers, I never went to parties, drank alcohol, or tried drugs. I did not attend my senior prom, nor did I ask anyone or care to. I simply wanted to reach academic escape velocity and to produce enduring things. On prom weekend, I finished writing a science fiction novel instead. My love for fictional worlds was greater than my love of the physical one.
I got deep into computer games in high school. I had no social life, so I interacted with the outside world through games and internet forums. I remember Metal Gear Solid 2 and the Xenosaga series as some of my favorite PS2 games. On PC, I fell in love with the original Fallout games and a fantasy RPG called Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura. The premise was a steampunk industrial revolution in a fantasy world, with magic and technology opposed to each other in the game mechanics. While the game itself was enjoyable, I resonated more with the fan forum, where I made a few lifelong connections with foreign friends. One of these friends was Chuck from Singapore.
It was Chuck who introduced me to his country’s history. In particular, I learned about Lee Kuan Yew and how he’d turned a third-world country into a first-world economy in mere decades. I read about the history of Singapore as it transformed from a British colony into an independent city-state. It was enough to make me want to visit or live there as a life-long goal. That goal, however, would have to wait for almost a decade.
I still had to get through college. High school had been a collection of high and low points—mostly low. I’d still do it the same save, perhaps exercising more. I was unsure whether college would be more of the same. 
Either way, I was about to find out. 
Hard STEM
Since high school, I had mentally prepared myself to go into science, tech, engineering, and math (STEM). For a time, I was enthralled by an article from Dr. Simmons’ biology lab on nanorobotics at Cornell University. I was deeply immersed in nanotechnology, especially due to the science fiction portrayal of that field. At the time, I was enthralled by cyberpunk and transhumanist science fiction. I was overly naïve and idealistic about how advanced we would become, but I knew my future would likely involve research. This did not preclude other concerns, like the benefits of physical fitness to my long-term health. What was the point of advanced nanotech if you did not live long enough to enjoy it, especially due to a preventable disease? 
In the summer before college, I once more got in better physical shape. The weight came off, but the awkwardness did not. If my high school social life was a desert, my college social life was a minefield crossed with a treasure hunt. Since I encountered a much larger pool of people, each new social situation could be either rewarding or wretched. I met some people I was glad to know and some I could not wait to escape. My first social encounter occurred before I arrived on campus. I received a postcard from The College of New Jersey (TCNJ) with contact information for my future roommate, Andrew. Like me, he had an Italian last name. Like me, he was worried about being paired with a party animal. That is where our similarities ended.
I went into college as a biology major since I thought it would allow me to move into nanotechnology. I would not stay a biology major. My first roommate’s major was business, and we had very few interests in common. I enjoyed martial arts and reading, while he was a band member in a long-term relationship. However, our personal differences were not a significant cause of friction. I did not meet him until move-in day, when I brought more stuff than I ended up using. I had brought a large green tub of books, which served to support an electric fan during those first few humid summer weeks. Fortunately, I was on the first floor of a ten-level dormitory, the “Travers and Wolfe” towers, which were easily the tallest structures on campus. 
My first semester’s course load was unchanged by the fact that I had passed AP Biology and AP US History. I had to take calculus, biology, chemistry, and an elective based on a survey we completed before the semester. For me, this elective was “Coming of Age in Science Fiction.” Most of the books were classics in the genre, although a few, like John Fowler’s The Magus, were new to me. While studying for other classes, I began to read biographies of influential scientists across history. One of these was Richard Feynman, who coined the term “nanotechnology” in his essay: “Plenty of Room at the Bottom.” The more I learned about him, the more I liked him. My friend recommended I read about Alan Sokal’s hoax in the 90s, where he submitted a bogus paper to a prestigious culture studies journal, only to have it accepted by an oblivious editor. The incident made me think of a particular Feynman quip: “Never confuse education with intelligence. You can have a Ph.D. but still be an idiot.” Their hostility towards empiricism and the universality of science made me glad I was in a hard STEM field. 
That was a very apt description of much of what passed for cultural studies. I’d grown up reading about courageous anthropologists like Margaret Mead, who traveled to remote places to understand other cultures. I had read about important subfields of speculative fiction, like Afrofuturism in science fiction and fantasy. I erroneously presumed that cultural studies would focus on the context, influences, and effects of various traditions, media, and socio-economic analyses. Instead, it was largely an insular clique of affluent individuals, separated from those that were supposedly the object of their fixation. 
What I found most tragic was that there were some very good scholars and cultural commentators I had the privilege of reading and interacting with, those who documented the story of humankind. But, like Alan Sokal, much of what I saw was nonsense. Based on critiques of cultural studies as they existed, I agreed with the theory that isolation from the very object of study reduced the ability to provide meaningful data. 
As such, I came to appreciate the value of direct observation in life, research, and recreation. After all, what’s the point of loving something if you can’t throw yourself into the middle of it? Even if you hate or detest something, I felt I owed it to myself to determine the true scope and scale of the opposition. 
In that spirit, I joined several college clubs at the start of the year. Like many of my other interests, I only stuck with a few. The primary club I stuck with freshman year was aikido club, mostly because I thought an instructor was very good-looking, though he was an international business major who was soon to graduate. 
As the temperature grew colder, I spent less time outdoors. Slowly and surely, the weight crept back on. The college’s meal plan was not particularly helpful in maintaining my desired body composition. The first semester drew to a close, and exams hit like a freight train. But I endured, preparing to return for the second semester. Leaving was never an option. If anything, I shifted to hard mode.
Before re-registering for the spring semester, I changed my major to biomedical engineering. I wanted to be closer to applied science, where I could build something that could directly improve the lives of others. I was still interested in nanotechnology, naïvely believing it to be the technological panacea from untold science fiction novels. However, as I explored the field, I came to find value in other areas: prosthetics and robotics. 
For a time, I believed that the brain-computer interface (BCI), in the science-fictional sense of a still-viable brain in a jar, might be the most reliable way to extend human life. I read about the research of Georgia Tech’s Steven Potter, who created the field of neural engineering. I explored the eccentric publications of the British professor Kevin Warwick, who infamously conducted experiments on himself with implanted devices. 
My naïve assumptions mattered little if I did not graduate. Instead of taking four classes in biology, I now had to take five classes in engineering, most of which were lab- and math-heavy. I had wanted STEM, and now I was in one of the most challenging STEM programs in the university. At the same time, I still regularly visited the clubs I had decided to stick with. I even participated in a choreographed martial arts fight for a variety show, which I did again every subsequent year. The spring semester was rough compared to the first, but there were a few pleasant surprises. My roommate, Andrew, arranged a signed banner for my birthday when I was depressed. I settled into a comfortable circle of friends in both science and engineering. 
During the summer after freshman year, I took a job doing overnight stock at a local department store. I was well aware that if I was unfortunate enough not to complete my program, these were the people with whom I would be working. That was a rude wake-up call in more ways than one. Seeing the human toll of that work on my coworkers, many of whom were juggling multiple jobs, showed me what was in store if I failed to graduate. My summer was not relaxing, and I returned for the hardest semester yet. My Tuesday class schedule went from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., with only a short break for lunch, and I also had classes every other day of the week. In retrospect, this moment was the hardest point of my undergraduate studies.
After sophomore year, the remaining classes were far more interesting. I eventually worked with an amazing advisor, who supported my solo senior project, a martial arts dummy outfitted with sensors for injury analysis. I spent more and more time with tabletop and play-by-post roleplaying, and met my friend R.K. online. R.K. and I conducted a techno-thriller and crime roleplaying campaign set in a fictional California city. I spent the summer of my junior year interning as a clinical engineer at a local hospital. 
My senior year was my easiest. By that point, I’d already mastered the routine to power through engineering coursework. The AP and community college classes I had taken before university helped make my final semester a relaxing one. My graduation day was indoors, due to a rainy May. I was not as happy as I should have been.
My true path was towards BCI. I applied to several graduate schools and received a positive response from only one. My parents wanted me to get a job. It was the middle of 2008, and I figured there was something else I could do instead of a doctoral program: a master’s degree. I searched for nearby schools I could apply to on short order. 
Fortunately, I lived near Rowan University, which had a well-regarded engineering program. I managed to get into Rowan University’s master’s program, but I had to take some signal processing and machine learning classes to catch up to the electrical engineering research being performed in their lab. 
I was stuck between STEM and a hard place. 
Lessons from Imagination
In college, I swam into a larger social pool than I had in high school. As much as I wanted to leave New Jersey or study abroad, my finances and engineering degree precluded it. Being an engineer meant taking a full course load every semester, and because I had transferred from biology, I was already a few classes behind. I had limited contact with students who had started as engineering majors. This once more led to social isolation, although far less so than in high school. I nevertheless continued in my creative endeavors.
I was keenly aware that classes took priority over recreation, and I was in no position to slack off. Academics came first, no matter the costs to my social life or writing schedule. I wanted to make it to grad school, and my major was difficult enough. That said, I tried to increase the challenges in my creative endeavors as well.
In my senior year of high school, I finished my trilogy of religious science fiction novels, Necessary Evil, and I continued a few short stories during summer vacation. I also ran my first online Dungeons and Dragons (3.5 edition) campaign, a steampunk fantasy romp inspired by Jules Verne’s Journey to the Center of the Earth. This was inspired by mainlining music from Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Blind Guardian, Tool, Manowar, and Symphony X. 
My musical tastes in this period leaned towards symphonic metal, which combined classical music and heavy metal. I tended towards a combination of power metal and old-school speed metal, with an occasional touch of progressive metal. Broadly speaking, I enjoyed the metal aesthetic nicknamed “Heavy Mithril,” fantasy-inspired metal that often incorporated classical or traditional instruments and sounds.
My favorite band of this genre was Blind Guardian, a German symphonic metal band. They made each album as epic and over-the-top as possible. They released Nightfall on Middle Earth, a concept album about Tolkien’s Silmarillion. Blind Guardian was the soundtrack to my last two years of high school and first two years of college. They still are part of my playlist, but other names have joined them. 
In college, I expanded my musical and aesthetic tastes. I added some hip-hop, like RZA (and classic Wu-Tang Clan) and Lupe Fiasco. I got interested in folk metal, from the Nordic Amon Amarth to the Mongolian throat-singing Hu. I listened to metal from around the world, such as China’s Tang Dynasty and The Samans, Vedic metal like Rudra, and others. Whatever I liked ended up on my playlist, from MIA to Jolin Tsai to JJ Lin to Rammstein to YG Family.
I encountered few people that were media omnivores. Even fewer were genre omnivores, with a wide range of interests in speculative fiction. Around this time, I became interested in New Weird classics like China Mieville’s Perdido Street Station and Bas-Lag books. I was all about throwing stuff together to see what worked. I wrote many experimental stories in this era, including the story of an alternative American Revolution crossed with a fantasy world war (Father of Lights), a sci-fi family thriller about a girl adopted by an AI (Daughter of the Machine), and a more grounded techno-thriller about decentralized groups fighting against the status quo (I-War). While these stories are awful by my current standards, they were necessary experiments in style and concept.
The best thing that came out of this experimentation was a more systematic method of worldbuilding. I had always put more thought into concepts than characters, since setting determines character arc. Many of my favorite writers, like Lovecraft, Asimov, and Clarke, put concepts above characters. While literary works can have both (and the best writers blend them), up to this point, I had overwhelmingly focused on concepts. 
I drew an important conclusion from this period: in certain circumstances, anyone can be correct. However, the separation from reality required for some worldviews is excessive. For example, a religious fundamentalist might decry a new corporate policy as “evil” out of theological concerns, instead of economic ones. In that way, two separate people arriving at similar points could concur, if only for a second. The sheer scope and scale of human history have allowed all manner of ideologies, causes, societies, and cultures to have their moments. There is no such thing as absolute political, economic, or cultural answers, at least weighed against abstract extremes. 
However, this does not preclude the fight for a better tomorrow. Of the billions who have walked upon this Earth, most would work hard, fight, and even die to ensure that their children, successors, and peers could enjoy a fruitful future. However, technologies and economies change, and what worked in prior eras, also changes. Of course, there are also the ancillary questions: “What works for whom?” or “How do you define a system ‘working’ at all?”
This is where the most significant political differences tend to emerge. These divisions also follow geography and economy. For example, a port city’s maritime urban economy could have more influence on shipbuilders than farmers. The merchants who own the ships and the merchandise on them might have more wealth than the shipbuilders. Even a foreign invasion or domestic rebellion would face similar economic incentives to take advantage of the city’s prime location as a maritime trading hub. Just as convergent evolution drives comparable adaptations across biological lineages, so too do comparable economic and political factors across cultural differences. 
In my hypothetical thalassocracy, if you asked what policies and philosophies a farmer, shipbuilder, and merchant would have, you’d get three different answers. Whatever political or economic equilibrium they achieved could be overturned by unforeseen events. If an earthquake destroyed the port and caused a famine, the farmers would suddenly find themselves at a strong economic advantage, if only for a time. That time might be enough for them to organize or change the socio-economic environment to their liking. History is full of such examples, as is the fiction it has inspired.
I lived through quite a few such examples. While 9/11 had happened a few years before I started college, additional disasters abounded. The Bush Administration botched its handling of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. In two strategic backwaters, the War on Terror ground down to pointless attrition, waste, and death. To top it off, the economy crashed in 2008, the year I graduated. In the US, the people at the top happily rescued the banksters behind the collapse, codifying the trend of rewarding the most incompetent elites. The European Union, developed Asian countries, and the rest of the world made similar moves—with Iceland as a notable exception, jailing the banksters instead of bailing them out.
It was unsurprising that these years created a wave of dystopian fiction. The stories that resonate with the bulk of the population at any given moment are those that make it big. There was enough alienation, dejection, and outright hostility to fuel a decade of dystopian fiction. While Hunger Games was the most prominent example, the first draft of Squid Game was also written at this time by a South Korean who had to pawn his laptop to survive. 
When I graduated, I was creatively rudderless for a time. I was not accepted into the graduate programs I’d hoped to attend. My student loans ripped into my paltry savings, and I had only sparse income from an internship-turned-part-time job. I frantically applied to master’s programs at local schools and decided on a well-regarded (and mercifully local) engineering university: Rowan. It was not what I wanted, but it was all I had. Just as the status quo can change on a dime, so too could events in my life. The important thing was to ride the wave and wait for an opportunity. 
In simpler terms: Never give up. 
The Grad School Next Door
While growing up, I was aware there was a major university within a few miles. When I was in elementary school, I had seen a production of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe on campus. In the nadir that followed my graduation, I applied hurriedly to every engineering master’s program I could. The main program I ended up attending was at the school next door, Rowan University.
Rowan University, located outside of Philadelphia, was previously a teacher’s college, Glassboro State College. When the industrialist Henry Rowan gave them a large grant, the college changed its name to commemorate him. Henry Rowan had invented an inductive furnace that improved steel output, giving him a large fortune. He sought to rectify the lack of an engineering school in South Jersey and thus made Rowan University’s engineering college a top priority.
It was my good fortune that Rowan was within commuting distance from my parents’ house. In the time between my trip to campus as an elementary student and my return as a graduate student, I had taken one class at Rowan: Organic Chemistry I. I took it as a summer class while an undergrad at TCNJ to help alleviate my course load during the semester. Now I would be diving deep into a very different flavor of engineering. I had previously taken mechanical classes, but due to my interest in BCI, I needed to learn much more about electrical engineering.
I would be working in the lab of a stern Turkish professor who did not mess around. I recall that, while his office had pictures of scenic Cappadocia in Turkey, his lab was all business. The lab was originally in the engineering building but was eventually relocated to the new tech park a few minutes down the road. This was a new field, a new challenge, and a new university to explore.
I partook in some on-campus activities when I could. Among them was parkour, which I struggled with at first. It took a certain blend of courage and recklessness to try some of the movements, and I never quite got some of them down. While the “freerunners” generally preferred showy moves, I took a page from parkour “purists,” focusing solely on the most efficient way to traverse obstacles. 
Boy, was this the right time for that. I encountered a number of obstacles during my first semester. I worked as a tutor in the math department part-time, but that was not enough to fully cover my expenses. The course content was especially tough for me. I made friends with foreign graduate students from China, Taiwan, and India. Though I did enjoy the campus, I spent more time than I wanted at home. Something good came of all of this, however. 
Back then, the History Channel still included some quality programming on actual history. One show, Ancient Discoveries, consisted of attempts to rebuild and test historical technologies from period-accurate materials (as best as possible with a limited budget). From one episode, I learned of two famous inventors of China’s Song Dynasty, Su Song and Shen Kuo. This period in history immediately sparked my imagination, especially the polymathy of Su Song. 
There was also a tragic aspect of Su Song’s story. Su Song built the Celestial Engine, the largest mechanical clock in the world at the time. It was so complex that, when the invading Jurchens took it apart, they could not put it together again. Even in a period when the Chinese were pioneering techniques and technologies that would not make it to the West for centuries, such knowledge was all destroyed by random chance. First came the Jurchens, and shortly afterward came the Mongols. As in the Shelley poem “Ozymandias,” the works of the greatest minds in history are at the mercy of fickle fates. 
I received a major physical injury while practicing parkour. While practicing vaults over a low brick wall, my leg was sliced open. The laceration was almost as long as a pen, running neatly along my shin. I staggered back to my post in the Math Department to seek help. The secretary noticed the trail of blood before I said anything. So began my first trip to the emergency room, and I came home that night hobbling on crutches with stitches in my leg. 
Thus ended my first semester in pain, debt, and depression. Despite my mood, I persevered. My fortunes changed (literally and figuratively) when my professor got funding for another graduate student. That was my first taste of academic funding, and it would not be my last. Compared to working in another dead-end job, getting paid for doing research was a more attractive lifestyle. I mainlined knowledge about MATLAB, machine learning, electroencephalography, and EEGLAB. Suddenly, I knew I had found my calling. This would take me places far and high.
That spring and summer went far better for me, despite my cut temporarily re-opening. I avoided parkour and martial arts while my leg recovered, and I have never since had quite the same interest in Muay Thai or kickboxing. However, I came out of that winter eager to get in shape. I adjusted my diet and exercise routine almost immediately. I started doing bodyweight drills and daily workouts and started eating better. By the end of the summer, I’d lost over 60 pounds (~27 kg), just in time for my first flight.
Late that summer, I attended my first academic conference, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Engineering in Medicine and Biology Conference (EMBC), in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This was one of the biggest biomedical engineering conferences in the world, and the university covered our travel and lodging expenses. It was my first time on a plane and my first time visiting the Midwest. It was quite a pleasant experience. 
At the time, flying was a novelty to me, despite the post-9/11 security theater. I chatted with the passenger beside me during the brief flight, and I was surprised by how polite the Midwesterners were. The city of Minneapolis and its twin, St. Paul, were marvels to me. There were skyways connecting the buildings, so I could cross the whole downtown indoors. The city itself was clean and pedestrian-friendly, unlike the filthy and dodgy parts of Philadelphia. The locals were polite, especially compared to the rude rat-racers of New Jersey. 
The conference itself was a chance to network. I listened to people from all over the world and attended random sessions that struck my interest. The whole world of biomedical engineering was a wonderful one to me, full of excitement and fascinating concepts. In addition to brain-computer interfaces, I was interested in meditation, artificial organs, prosthetics, and sport biomechanics. We also explored the surrounding city in our downtime, and I recall jogging around the convention center to get a feel for the place. 
I remember seeing a few high-profile researchers from big-name universities. Even they had problems that seemed familiar to me, from projector malfunctions to personal dramas. Even the best-equipped institutions can be thwarted by circumstance, internal politics, and sclerotic structures. Su Song left his country at the apex of its power: the Song had a precursor to the Bessemer process that enabled cheap steel production, early gunpowder weapons, paper money, and other innovations. Su Song’s contemporary Wang Anshi had set up a social welfare system for the country. Due to corruption, even the great general Yue Fei could not save the Song Dynasty from the Jin. Despite perfecting anti-cavalry warfare and defeating heavy cavalry like the Jin Iron Pagoda troops, the Song dynasty fell to the Mongols after four decades.
I reflected on the lesson that survival required adaptability. To become stagnant was to make oneself brittle. I felt I needed to learn this lesson by broadening my horizons. I studied mindfulness meditation and became interested in the documented evidence that it expanded neuroplasticity. From this, I found the core topic of my master’s thesis: the effects of meditation on brain-computer interface performance. Due to a limited subject pool, we didn’t have a large enough sample size to draw any robust conclusions. Ironically, as I defended my thesis, someone published a similar study to my own, finding a statistically significant positive relationship between BCI performance and meditation. Though I did not get the results I was looking for, this did not mean that my concept was invalid. It just meant someone else had gotten there first.
As my research at Rowan University wrapped up, a new opportunity presented itself. I was offered a potential doctoral position at the University of Delaware, where my parents had met. Since I would not exist without that university and it had a very well-regarded engineering school, I accepted the position without a second thought. While Rowan had shown me the importance of powering through bad times, Delaware would show me the limits of that approach. 
Like Su Song, I would find there were limits to my abilities. Unlike Su Song, I would be around to see everything crash and burn. 
The way through some disasters is riding through until hitting rock bottom. 
Spontaneous Academic Combustion
The University of Delaware (UD) is one of the more prestigious public universities in the area where I grew up. Many of my cousins attended, as well as my parents, aunts, and uncles. In short, it is a place where I had deep ties even before I arrived. Aside from a visit in high school when I was applying to colleges, I was largely unfamiliar with the campus. I am still unsure what to think about my time there. 
I arrived in the winter of 2010 after my Rowan research funding ended. I secured an on-campus apartment, which I shared with another graduate student. In the apartment below were two who would become close friends, a student from Tanzania and another from the Middle East. I met other friends from Brazil, Germany, India, China, Korea, and across the U.S. In short, I traveled upstream from a small pond to a Great Lake. But all was not well.
At the time, I was working on a project to make a new type of electronic device, specifically, a spintronic biosensor, which used changes in electron spin to test for the presence of certain biological compounds for environmental monitoring. The fabrication of such devices was far more complex and painstaking than I imagined. It involved making the devices on computer-aided software, making molds for photolithography, systematically etching each layer into silicon wafers, all while performing the process under a microscope in a clean room. A single mistake would result in having to restart.
Such frustrations were enough to cause me to start looking elsewhere. At the time, UD did not have a well-developed biomedical engineering program. The few professors interested in this area were in other departments, such as electrical or mechanical engineering, based on whatever was closest to their specific application. As a result, I started looking abroad. This was how I came across an opportunity in New Zealand.
One place I was looking for opportunities was the website FindAPhD.com. At the time, my parents were against it. My dad thought a foreign degree would not be as valuable to US employers. My mother was worried I would not be able to take care of myself. Despite this, I was dead set on proving both of them wrong. Continuing a long-running pattern, I was doing many things they were unaware of.
I applied to the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. Not only was I admitted, but I also received a scholarship. I then secured on-campus lodging in Christchurch and even found the flight itinerary to get there, including the relevant travel times. My parents were more than surprised to find I had already planned my trip in such detail.
I had picked up other activities during my stay there. While I had lost much of my interest in my research, I was pleased with the small university town of Newark, Delaware. I lived on campus near a noisy railway, with freight trains rolling in every few hours. The town had a pedestrian-friendly main street lined with small shops, a host of clubs I explored, and a well-provisioned gym. I had tried everything from fencing to capoeira, from tabletop roleplaying to debating. I even helped save a debate club, the Socratic Club, by inviting some friends to participate, who used debate to learn and practice English. When I attended a cousin’s wedding, I demonstrated my break-dancing skills on the dance floor. My parents were quite surprised I was secretly a dancer.
While at Delaware, I kept up my physical activity with a strict daily morning routine. I would alternate between acrobatics and bodyweight training days with a regimen my cousin, a personal trainer, worked out for me. I would jog for at least half an hour most days, and every other day I would wear a weight vest while jogging at least four miles. At the time, my joints could take most of it. Sometimes I would even perform parkour moves as I went down Newark’s Main Street. I kicked off of benches to get airborne and dodged pedestrians like a pro. I tried to move like a character from the Assassin’s Creed games, specifically the Ezio saga, which I was really into at the time. 
For some time, I worked as a teaching assistant, grading papers and assisting undergrads in the lab. Most of the content was basic circuit design, but the undergrads always impressed me with their ingenuity. Somehow, one of them figured out how to melt a resistor into a plastic breadboard with the limited power supplies available in the lab. To this day, I am unsure how exactly she managed that particular feat. 
I made several friends on campus who helped me through my decision. I keep in touch with many of them and I even visited a few of these friends after they graduated or left UD. The best thing that happened at Delaware was seeing what awaited me in American academia at a top-tier research school with a population of international students. My inability to engage  there was primarily due to my own stress and internal conflict. My advisor and lab mates were supportive, and part of me felt bad leaving. 
Delaware was a good school, but it was not my school. I indirectly owed my existence to this place, so I felt conflicted about the decision to leave. It was within an hour’s drive of where I grew up. Again, I felt choked and hemmed in by a reality that seemed limited to the Delaware Valley. I wanted to broaden my horizons beyond what my parents had experienced. Their earlier warnings did not deter me but instead enticed me toward the challenge. 
At Delaware, I realized that networking was often the best advantage of a university. Having a broader network than just my peers was a unique advantage in an interconnected world. Why not expand that web of contacts beyond the region where I grew up? For the goals I could not yet realize, I had to put them on hold until I could find a way to get there. If the road had obstacles, the obstacles would become the path. Sometimes, that would require taking a long, slow dive into the unknown. What started as spontaneous academic combustion would become a path to living in places I never expected. 
In that way, UD was once more responsible for my current existence. 
The Road to Aotearoa
Obama was elected President during my first semester at Rowan. There was much excitement in anti-war and progressive circles (including college campuses) and much anxiety among conservatives. The 2008 economic crash and the Bush bailout under TARP led directly to the Obama-era Democrats sweeping the election like a political wildfire. This was also the year the Phillies won the World Series. However, only disappointments would follow.
Obama rapidly jettisoned the progressives who brought him into office in favor of Clinton-era hacks and Bush-era appointees. He did his best to defend the banks, despite the carefully curated image of the opposite. He ran as a populist and outsider due to his rejection of the Iraq War, although he would later become involved in new conflicts. He was a machine politician with an expertly managed image, embodied by his portrait emblazoned with the word “HOPE.” He nevertheless was the darling of both the establishment and outsiders, at least at first. 
Around this time, I read into the history of underground American journalism. While there were many underground papers active in the 1960s (much to the consternation of the FBI and CIA), a particular figure stood out to me from a century earlier: Ida Bell Wells-Barnett. She was only a generation removed from slavery in the Deep South, and she lived through the worst of Reconstruction, exposing the horrors of racism. Despite threats of assault, murder, and worse, she reported the abominations of segregation, lynching, and racist terrorism of her era. She embodied the fact that power fears scrutiny, especially from the marginalized. 
More recently, the contrast between the appendages of power and underground media emerged when Wikileaks released leaked diplomatic cables. These detailed the corruption of the dictators of several Middle Eastern countries, sparking protests in Tunisia that went viral. Egypt was next, and Libya soon collapsed into civil war. Obama was there to help protect the Gulf monarchies from any remote chance of reform, for instance, by helping Saudi Arabia occupy Bahrain. He later cynically signed off on a certain Saudi prince’s genocidal invasion of Yemen, after expanding the drone assassination program and failing to close Gitmo. Though he ordered the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, he kept American forces in Afghanistan until the end of his term. He also did his best to target independent media. 
And that’s before we even get to his domestic policies. Towards the end of my stay in the US, in 2012, Obama helped ram through a repulsive bill called the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). It would normally have been a non-controversial defense funding bill, but troubling attachments were added that allowed the military to indefinitely detain Americans and others without due process. Obama massively expanded surveillance and police power, and he even pioneered the due-process-free drone assassination of American citizens, as we saw with Anwar al-Awlaki and his 16-year-old son. 
Opposition to the Obama Administration was largely focused on his healthcare bill. At first, there was anger at Obama for defending the banks, which was later hijacked by a Koch Brothers astroturf campaign into the Tea Party. Obama gave away more land for oil and gas drilling than any previous President, but his nominal opponents still tried to attack his greenwashed corporatism. In a classic example, BP rebranded itself as “Beyond Petroleum,” just before the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite having one of the worst oil spills in decades happen on his watch, Obama did his best to maintain his greenwashed image.
That image trumped reality (pun intended). In the lead-up to the 2010 midterm election, Glenn Beck peaked in popularity on the back of the Tea Party. The Affordable Care Act was largely a copy-and-pasted version of a plan from Obama’s 2012 opponent, then-Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, itself based on a 1990s Republican proposal from Newt Gingrich. Even the popular conspiracy theory of the era, the Obama birther concept stating that Obama was born in Kenya, originated from Hillary Clinton supporters during the 2008 primaries (the first defeat of Hillary’s presidential ambitions). The Democratic Party, thus, continued its lurch down the neoliberal road. Their Republican opponents followed along, since the establishment figures were owned by the same donor class. One of the most iconic images of late-administration Obama was him smoking a cigarette with a smug half-smirk, as though thinking of how he had just told a room full of idiots what they wanted to hear.
Other things changed as well. There was a growing acceptance of LGBT rights, a positive thing in my book, but growing hostilities to what used to be the bedrocks of governance. Civil rights and freedom of speech were viewed with increasing suspicion by the Democratic Party and its neoliberal counterparts in the Commonwealth and EU. Despite the apparent promise of internet openness toppling dictators in the Middle East, this drove Obama to embrace the worst of Bush (but in a more eloquent way). The Democrats soured on democracy, and much of the OECD’s former center-left parties agreed. 
The financial disaster continued in the EU, as Greece and the peripheral countries were pressured to sell public assets. Only Iceland dared to jail its corrupt financial class, though with only mild sentences. China continued to develop quickly, while India rolled on behind it. The possible emergence of BRICS (Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa) as a united economic actor was heavily considered by the economic experts of the time. This would not come to be, but another economic actor was only getting started.
That actor was Bitcoin, the first of the blockchain currencies. While the founder Satoshi Nakamoto is still shrouded in mystery, the rise of decentralized finance prompted dismissals from traditional financial elites and their media organs. Other alternative currencies had yet to reach the mainstream, but the precedent was set. I argue that we can see here the beginnings of a serious decentralization movement, one which could bypass the mega-states and economic blocs of yesteryear. The heirs of the cypherpunks now had analogs in media and finance, much to the dismay of traditional nation-states and corporations. I believe that Ida B. Wells would be interested in such an endeavor, and how it might support the rise of citizen-journalists. 
That theme was covered in a novel I’d read at the time, Daemon by Daniel Suarez, and its sequel Freedom™. I avidly played video games with similar themes, including Assassin’s Creed and Deus Ex: Human Revolution. I also read many classic pulp short stories, notably those by Robert E. Howard and H. P. Lovecraft. Howard’s themes of civilization against barbarism, or individuals against institutions, really stuck with me during this time. In contrast to longer novels, I mainly wrote serially-formatted stories in which each chapter was a self-contained adventure. 
In these stories, like in life, individuals stood against the corruption around them to avoid compromising their morals. Unlike in the stories, in real life, this rarely ended well. Nevertheless, such disclosure was required sometimes, from Ida B. Wells’ journalism to Daniel Ellsberg’s Pentagon Papers to the recent revelations. Power yields nothing on its own, and there is no solution to error other than criticism and resistance. As Wells put it, “A Winchester rifle should have a place of honor in every black home, and it should be used for that protection which the law refuses to give.” 
While institutions failed individuals, they also failed the environment. Both greenwashing and carbon dioxide levels continued to climb.  More worryingly, methane clathrates in the Arctic circle started bubbling up and igniting. I believed that an isolated, primarily agricultural, self-sufficient country would be ‘safe’ in a global catastrophe. Many in Silicon Valley would later come to a similar conclusion. I also had far more compelling reasons to relocate to New Zealand (or in Maori, Aotearoa), such as how the native Maori were the most successful example of direct and indirect indigenous resistance in the English-speaking world. My parents’ assumption that an international degree may not be valued as highly as one from the US was even more appealing, since I did not want an easy life. I wanted to test myself against what the future could offer me. I knew too many people that took the easy way out, and I did not want to be one of them. 
Like a barbarian hero against a great beast, I threw myself at the world. 
Earth and Fire
It was my first trip outside the United States, save for the technicality that the UN building in New York is considered international territory. While I had been to the UN building for a field trip in elementary school, now I would meet a virtual United Nations of students at a university in an earthquake-ravaged city at the edge of the world. This was a new experience for me in many ways, including the 36-hour plane trip it took to get there.
I arrived in New Zealand at the end of May 2012, going from late spring to late autumn. My first month was a challenge, as I realized this would be a year of two winters. There was even a light dusting of snow when I arrived. I stayed in a small room at the edge of campus, jogging out on cold, dark mornings and arriving back at early nightfall. I had a scholarship for exactly 36 months, so I wanted to use my time as efficiently as possible. 
I spent my first year in a room of undergraduates, enduring their raucous parties and cleaning up empty beer cans each weekend. I kept the sink clean and vacuumed weekly since I did not want to think too much about what had touched each surface. As a result, I kept to the graduate students whenever possible. I was fortunate to change to a graduate student residence in the time that followed. 
My residence was not without its scenery. The view was astounding. I could see the hills of the Banks Peninsula to the south and, on clear days, the peaks of the Southern Alps to the west. Each morning and evening, I biked through scenic Hagley Park and its beautiful Botanic Gardens  on the way to my lab beside the hospital. Even in its damaged state, calling Christchurch scenic was an understatement.
Despite the beauty, I followed events back home. One event of note was the Global Futures 2045 conference in New York City, hosted by a Russian oligarch named Dmitri Itskov. Itskov was the founder of a minor Russian political party and of the 2045 Initiative, which proclaimed that it would build artificial bodies for human brains. August personalities in robotics and transhumanist circles, such as Oxford professor Anders Sandberg and futurist Ray Kurzweil, attended this conference. Such things were overshadowed by my daily routine. 
My day consisted of waking up, jogging or going to the gym, biking to work, writing code to analyze results, and heading back to my room. The legacy code of my direct predecessor in the lab was incomplete, so it took a year to replicate the results published in a prior paper. The purpose of my work was to improve the electrophysiological-based detection of lapses in a driver’s responsiveness, a task to which I applied several algorithms from implemented in BCI systems. I also engaged in several other activities on a whim.
The most conventional of those activities was participating in student clubs. I tried out martial arts of various types, joined the Maker Society for 3D printing, learned kapa haka in Te Akatoki (the Maori student club), and participated in the international student club. I organized several outings for international students, such as throwing a Christmas event for those stuck on campus and organizing trips to a local indoor rifle range (where I was introduced to a target sport called small-bore shooting). I had an international group of friends from places as obscure as Tonga, Mongolia, Bhutan, New Caledonia, and all across Europe, Asia, South America, and Africa. I would take monthly trips with many of these friends to the rifle range, where we had friendly competitions shooting small targets with .22 LR-converted Martini rifles. 
Then there was my deep dive into local history. One aspect of this was technological history, as I studied the South Island’s most influential inventor, Dr. Colin Murdoch. A veterinarian and pharmacist (or a chemist, as it is known in NZ), he invented many important medical and research devices. These included the disposable syringe, the child-proof medical container, and the tranquilizer dart gun. Larger foreign companies shamelessly infringed on his patents for disposable syringes and child-proof containers, but Murdoch set up what would become one of New Zealand’s few enduring firearms manufacturers: Pax Arms. They only made dart projectors for field biology and veterinary medicine, and other devices specifically designed not to take life. They are still around today. 
I dove deep into the history of pre-colonial Christchurch, becoming a frequent visitor to the local museum. I even invited some of the other international students to visit and ran trivia contests related to museum exhibits. I visited other museums across the country, such as the Otago Museum of Natural History in Dunedin, the Auckland War Memorial Museum, and Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington. I also enjoyed quirkier locations, like the Oamaru Steampunk HQ and the tourist gimmicks built across the island. Naturally, there were several Lord of the Rings-themed tours. I traveled on my own, hostel hopping and couch surfing as necessary. Maori and colonial New Zealand history appealed to me far more than the history of Middle Earth. 
One of the most remarkable figures I researched was Te Ruki Kawiti, an ally of the Maori rebel Hone Heke. Kawiti was already an aged warrior at the start of the Flagstaff Wars, but he was virtually the Vauban of the South Pacific in terms of his use of fortification. Unlike that overrated French military architect of the early modern period, Kawiti had to innovate under fire rather than ripping off Italian designs. Kawiti grew up in a culture that did not have writing, gunpowder, or metalworking but would successfully defeat European armies within a generation. 
Prior to European colonization, the near extinction of whales in the Atlantic drove whalers to the South Pacific in the early 1800s. At the time, New Zealand was prime real estate since it could support a large population and was within reach of both the whale-filled Antarctic Ocean and the South Pacific. Maori tribes traded with sailors for guns and manufactured goods in exchanges that also involved prostitution. The largest city in New Zealand at the time was Russell, appropriately known as the Hellhole of the Pacific.
The British and French were economic competitors at the time, while the Americans and other nations were less present. The native Maori were waging the Musket Wars, in which the tribes that adopted modern weapons extended their power over those that did not. As a result, many of the native Maori were familiar with European methods of war. Kawiti and his ally Hone Heke were veterans of these conflicts. 
The dominant polity in New Zealand was the United Tribes of New Zealand, a Maori confederation of the strongest tribes. As the British and French expanded their influence throughout the country, the Unified Tribes issued a Declaration of Independence. Many of the other tribes thought they could get a better deal with the British, so they signed the Treaty of Waitangi, which stated that Maori would be given the rights of British citizens. However, in true colonial fashion, the treaty said one thing in English and another in Maori. This eventually led to the Flagstaff War, the first major conflict between the Maori and the British.
Hone Heke chopped down the British flag at a far-off garrison to demonstrate how remote the British truly were. The Maori rebels used a type of fortified trench, the gunfighter pa, to resist much larger armies. Kawiti was a particular master of designing gunfighter pa, such as those at Ohaeawai and Ruapekapeka. At the former, he goaded the British into a disastrous frontal assault, while the latter was ignobly abandoned for still-uncertain reasons. Hone Heke and Kawiti managed to secure pardons as a condition for surrender, and the British flag was chopped down three more times, with a fifth put up only after their deaths (from old age). 
I find a certain poetic element in Kawiti’s tactics. Kawiti literally used his homeland as a weapon against the world’s most powerful colonial army. Other Maori rebel groups would use pa against the British in the Land Wars, although for a larger variety of reasons (often related to the government seizing land to sell to settlers). Many of those who rebelled kept their land since their goal was not to drive out the British but to demonstrate the costs in the most forceful way possible. Even when you are outgunned and outnumbered, you are not outclassed. 
My research involved letting ensembles of AI classifiers run time-consuming algorithms on a large dataset, so I found other things to research and write in the meantime. I recalled the media panic over 3D-printed firearms in response to Defense Distributed releasing the files for a one-shot pistol called the Liberator. Despite the hype, plastic firearms of a sort were already in widespread use: early bamboo fire lances from Song China (essentially just weaponized firecrackers), flare guns for signaling (which are unable to handle the pressure of anything other than flares), and the ubiquitous potato cannons made by amateur physicists (again, limited in the pressure and power they can withstand). 
I used a simulated plastic pepperbox revolver model to demonstrate the limitations of the weak plastics used in 3D printing, and that the deformations of such plastic could be used as a forensic technique for determining the type of cartridge fired. Even the Liberator still required metal parts, and its release was an act of political symbolism more than an attempt to make a highly effective, undetectable firearm. Besides, (far better) zip guns had been made out of metal piping and scrap for over a century. Still, I did publish the first forensic technique for a 3D-printed firearm. Such technology might be useful for military historians and reenactors making replacement parts for firearms or stage armorers making custom props for science fiction films. Kawiti might have found the whole thing amusing. 
I also dabbled in cryptocurrency. I tried setting up a social enterprise in New Zealand with the goal of creating a cryptocurrency that would serve as a basic income system and local currency for earthquake-ravaged Christchurch. I went to New Zealand’s first (and, to my knowledge, only) cryptocurrency conference, “Bitcoin South,” held in scenic Queenstown. Sadly, it never went anywhere.
I had other fun experiences in New Zealand. I visited Abel Tasman National Park with friends. I climbed a ski resort mountain in shorts. I nursed a nasty machete cut while camping in a cold, damp downpour. I regularly hiked from Christchurch to Taylor’s Mistake, a scenic beach on the Banks Peninsula. I presented at a conference in Chicago, where I met up with my parents and returned home on a redeye flight from the Cook Islands. I researched antique and obscure weapons in museums and private collections, such as Te Kooti’s pinfire revolver and the Colt Navy revolvers used by Prussian adventurer Gustavus von Tempsky. I dated people from around the world, including my first serious relationship. I visited some long-time online friends in Australia. I explored each city and region of New Zealand, finding  Wellington and Dunedin to be especially nice, with the world’s most southern medical school and a unique Gothic-Scottish-Polynesian vibe. I even tried patenting an artificial body like the one Ikskov talked about, only for it to be dismissed as too speculative. 
There were some rough patches as well. Some of my excursions went south, literally and figuratively. On one Eastern trip, a friend brought along an odious old man with a criminal background, who turned out to be my friend’s romantic partner. At an isolated motel in a remote town, they demonstrated how physical their relationship was, and I got out as fast as I could. I was almost killed by cars twice, once by a negligent truck driver and once by someone accelerating at my bike as I crossed an intersection. I was stalked and attacked on more than one occasion. Then came the truly trying times. 
The hardest times hit in the last few months of my stay in New Zealand. My scholarship had expired, and I was living off savings. I had to work odd jobs for income, mostly as a tutor, teaching assistant, and note-taker. The worst was when I worked as a bouncer at a nightclub, where we had to hold someone for the cops to arrest (the nightclub also tried to get me to work without pay). I had to dumpster-dive for food to survive. I struggled for rent each month, selling off more and more of my possessions to pay for it. It was only because of my friends that I got through that rough period. Still, even living below my means as much as possible, more money was going out than coming in.
Once my savings were depleted, I was humiliated to ask my parents for help. They did, and thankfully, I was able to defend and submit my final thesis revisions. In those last few months, I knew things were not going well with my last living grandparent, my dad’s mother. Then, in October 2015, my grandmother passed away. My parents purchased a plane ticket, and I had to leave. I knew that on the other side of that flight, there were only student loans and the place I had wanted to flee, but I had to go. Things would not look up for a while. 
Once you see paradise, don’t become blind to other realities. 
Shadows over Aotearoa
New Zealand was a turning point for me in more ways than one. I had proven to myself and my social circle that I could live abroad and independently in a place where I initially knew no one. I had proven to myself the hardship I could endure and that I could accomplish things even under precarity and duress. I had undergone something none of my former peers had ever experienced, something I never thought I would do. I had also seen political things that gave me a very different view of my home and upbringing. 
New Zealand politics are a complex topic. It was largely a closed economy until former Prime Minister Robert Muldoon called a snap election while drunk. The resulting “Schnaps election” resulted in David Lange and his neoliberal henchman Roger Douglas coming to power in 1984. They started a wave of reforms and privatizations that were popular across the Anglophone countries. The government dithered between the right-centrist party (the Nationals) and the left-centrist party (Labour) in the decades that followed, without substantially changing its economic trajectory. 
While I was there, the incumbent Prime Minister was John Key, head of the National government. Like many other politicians around the developed world, he had a background in international finance. He used to work at Merrill Lynch, and he was known as the Smiling Assassin for the efficiency with which he closed deals. Like Tony Blair and Bill Clinton, he had a smugness and charisma that enabled him to endure repeated scandals. 
At the time, Key was pushing through three thoroughly rotten initiatives. One was the sale of New Zealand’s remaining publicly-owned assets, including the hydroelectric plants that powered much of the country and reserves of water and resources. He was trying to sell off the majority share of the government’s holding of such assets, in violation of the Treaty of Waitangi. The second initiative was forcing New Zealand into the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a small trade deal that ballooned into a wish list for corporate lobbyists. My American friends and family were sadly unaware of the TPP, which Obama was shilling for at the time. The third initiative was expanding oil and gas exploration and drilling around the country. 
Events back in the US caused me to view Obama’s Democratic Party as increasingly ominous. Drone assassinations and the 2012 NDAA were the appetizers, but worse followed. The Occupy protests exploded across the world, and Obama’s allegiance was to Wall Street. His Department of Homeland Security (DHS) even proposed assassinating protest leaders with sniper rifles if bank stock dropped substantially. Rich mayors across the country, most notably then-New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, coordinated a multi-state crackdown with the DHS. This would be the biggest protest crackdown for the better part of the decade. Black Lives Matter moved into public awareness during protests against the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, although it was not yet as well-known as it would become.
Other scandals continued around the world. In the UK, it was reported that one of the most important rates in finance, the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), had been manipulated since 1991. The European Union lurched and jerked as Greece protested against austerity-filled bailouts and loans. Even outside the Anglosphere, private finance consumed public assets. In mainland China, foreign financial companies gave executive positions to the children and relatives of Communist Party members. Many of the world’s wealthy traveled in similar circles, having more in common with each other than with the average citizens of their countries.
Suspicion of authority only increased as a result of the Snowden revelations. The fact that the world’s most sophisticated surveillance system was used to help politicians perform insider trading was often conveniently overlooked. Obama pulled every diplomatic dirty trick he could try to  capture Snowden, indicating just how much he hated whistleblowers. His treatment of the Wikileaks publisher, Julian Assange, was even worse. Obama, who largely campaigned on support for whistleblowers, was now the right hand of Wall Street and total surveillance.
Things moved in a worse direction geopolitically as well. The Syrian Civil War escalated to an unanticipated extent when a radical Sunni splinter group invaded Iraq, seizing the city of Mosul after the Iraqi Army folded like a cheap chair. Military operations against Daesh, or the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria/the Levant (ISIS/ISIL), commenced shortly afterward. The Obama White House supported other (non-ISIS/ISIL) Sunni radicals and Kurds, hoping one of them would topple the Syrian government. Instead, Iran and Russia intervened to help their beleaguered ally.
Elsewhere, snipers opened fire on a demonstration against a corrupt Ukrainian president. The country collapsed into chaos, and the Russians occupied Crimea, largely because it was one of Russia’s few warm water seaports, an easily defensible location, and an asset that the cruel calculus of power dictated they should keep by any means. The new Ukrainian president began privatizing state assets for foreigners, including giving a no-show job to then-Vice President Biden’s son Hunter. The Russians began closing ranks with the Chinese and other members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in Central Asia. The geopolitical scene would only get uglier from there.
No discussion of New Zealand’s geopolitics would be complete without the bizarre sagas of Kim Dotcom and Nicky Hager. The Kim Dotcom story began with a request to Vice President Biden from a longtime friend, Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) lobbyist and former senator Chris Dodd. Kim Dotcom was an eccentric German tech expat running a file-sharing site in New Zealand. Dodd wanted to whip these file-sharing sites into line by establishing a stricter legal structure, so he requested that Dotcom’s site be taken down and Dotcom be extradited for facilitating online piracy. The situation involved a SWAT team raiding Dotcom’s house, Dotcom appealing extradition in a local freakshow trial, and even Dotcom unsuccessfully running for New Zealand’s Parliament under the joint banner of the Internet-MANA Party in the 2014 general election. 
Then there was the more disturbing story of Nicky Hager. Hager was a local journalist who reported something that was a big scandal in New Zealand but would have been a non-issue elsewhere. It involved Key leaking embarrassing information to a friendly blogger, which had been acquired through a local intelligence agency. Police raided Hager’s house under controversial premises, and Hager was vilified by the National Party’s media organs. If such events occurred even in New Zealand, one of the countries ranked highest for freedom of the press, then they could happen anywhere. New Zealand still retains an office for media censorship, despite passing a Bill of Rights Act in 1992. Who knew what nightmares increasing censorship would bring?
My writings from the time reflected these current events. I wrote a dystopian cyberpunk science fiction novel, Ergo Sum, set in what I thought might be a post-collapse Delaware Valley. I wrote a Maori sword and sorcery adventure novel, Stone Against the Sea, to escape from the depressing present through my local history interests. I wrote two urban fantasy novels about the collision of undeath, technology, and finance, Medium of Exchange and Web of Debts. I wrote a supernatural adventure novella about werewolves battling in a Central American country, Blood Moon. I read writers like Peter Watts and Clark Ashton Smith, who remain favorites to the present. I also greatly enjoyed games like Civilization V, Assassin’s Creed III and IV, Skyrim, Spec Ops: The Line, and the Dead Space trilogy. Despite my escapist antics, reality always found a way to intrude. I learned to pay attention to local politics. 
In a foreign country, don’t ignore the local events. 
Sinking Feeling
At the end of 2015, I managed to get a postdoctoral position almost a month after returning to the US. In the month before that, I had gone through a personal nadir after my paternal grandmother passed away. After dumpster diving to survive in New Zealand, I had arrived home an emotional wreck. My grandmother’s funeral united that side of my family one last time before many of my cousins fled to the far corners of the world. I ended up getting the job I wanted as a postdoctoral researcher in a place a little too close to home: Maryland.
Officially, I was to work at the University of Texas-San Antonio. Because of the nature of the grant that funded the position, I had to live and work at the US Army Research Lab at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. To my high school self, who had called up Dr. Steven Wax at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Biological Technologies Office to ask for an internship, this would have been a dream come true. To my current self, a cynical world traveler, eager to once again escape from the Acela Corridor, it was not.
I spent a month researching on campus in San Antonio, a city I enjoyed. The River Walk, the Spanish architecture, the Alamo, the “haunted” Menger hotel, the US Army Medical Department Museum, the warm winter weather, and much of the history all simultaneously sparked my interest. However, this was not to last. I had to depart once more for the dreary Mid-Atlantic winter, which immediately followed my antipodal winter in New Zealand. 
Around that time, I read about Admiral Hyman Rickover. He was the father of the US Navy’s nuclear fleet, a World War II hero, and perhaps the role model for the best people in American military engineering. Not only a competent engineer in the Cold War, he also spoke out against the privatization of public assets that increasingly occurred towards the end of his career. If I was to continue working at Aberdeen, Rickover was the kind of person I would want to be: courageous, thorough, brilliant, and unafraid to take on the rich and politically powerful from within his organization. 
I had to live in the small town outside the base, in the sad sprawl of Aberdeen, Maryland. I considered two primary apartments, one low-cost and one upscale. The low-cost apartment looked like the door had been battered in, so I wisely decided against it. I had to pass through two consecutive checkpoints to get to my lab, which required special badging and clearance. As such, it was quite a place to work. 
I tried biking to work one day, and I almost died as a result. I decided to stick with driving for the remainder of my stay. The fact that most places I needed to reach were inaccessible by public transit or shuttle bus was quite a contrast with Christchurch. Even quake-ravaged Christchurch maintained a public transit system that connected the airport with train stations, outlying suburbs, nearby attractions, and the centers of nearby towns. Though New Zealand had far fewer resources than my own country, the densely populated corridor between Boston and the Beltway was still a car-dependent suburban sprawl. Being near to the Beltway, I was close to the worst traffic.
I avoided both rush hours by arriving at work as early as possible. I would typically wake up between 3:00 and 4:00 AM, exercise, clean up, have breakfast, and get to work around 5:45 AM. I was either first or second in the building, along with a fellow early riser, a veteran. My breakfast was any leftover office snacks from the prior evening. Some days I would go out for lunch with officemates, both on- and off-post. I preferred a local Korean place since the other area restaurants were just awful chains. Otherwise, I would have a homemade tofu salad for lunch. After work, I would get home around 3:00 or 4:00 p.m. I would stay longer if I had a meeting since I had supervisors in Aberdeen and San Antonio. I wondered how Rickover would have dealt with regular digital conferencing between time zones. Probably far better than I did in that era before Zoom went mainstream. 
My research topic was virtually the same as the topic of my Ph.D.: EEG-based drowsy-driver detection. Perhaps with some degree of irony, I tired of it. My lifestyle was that of a suburban professional commuter, working in a lab when I could just as easily work from home on these tasks. It was not an uncomfortable existence by any means. I enjoyed my coworkers, my residence, and my general mission. However, it was unfulfilling. I had wanted to see the world, but so far, I had only seen one small foreign country and one small region of my own. I would not die in the Acela Corridor, I promised myself. Anywhere else in the world, anywhere else in the USA, would suffice. 
I used my free time to learn and improve other skills. I volunteered for the local US Coast Guard Auxiliary flotilla, an organization I wish was more well-known. I became a Vessel Safety Examiner, essentially helping boat owners ensure their fire extinguishers and flares were up to date. I learned first aid, navigation, sailing, and other skills while trying to network as best I could. I frequently visited a charming nearby small town, Havre de Grace, sometimes thinking about the nautical exploits of the War of 1812 or the century-long poaching racket that was the Oyster Wars. I wondered how Rickover might have handled the technology of an earlier era or the petty violence that Maryland police often struggled to contain. Such musings, however, were eclipsed by the politics of 2016. 
While I will go into specifics later, Brexit and the repulsive US presidential candidates of that cycle bled over into tabletop conversations. I did not care enough to get involved in office politics, but these issues did ruin a few personal and professional relationships among people I knew. My dislike of the major candidates was enough to get the apologists for one candidate smearing the apologists for the other as sycophants. There was one positive personal accomplishment in the summer of 2016, however.
My longtime online friend R. K. came to live with me in person for a couple of weeks while looking for local work. I offered to host him, but we were hindered by his lack of an automobile and my commuting to work. We went on a few local adventures, like sailing, hiking, archery, and exploring a nearby historical manor. We successfully brainstormed worldbuilding and writing ideas on walks, although he was far more brusque than I had imagined him and I was far more normal than he expected me to be.
In what would become my most obsessive hobby, I became involved with an abortive startup called Humai. The founder, Josh, claimed he wanted to make humans immortal by creating a cyborg body to keep cryogenically preserved brains alive. In time, the biological components would be fully digitized. If that sounds like a load of crap, it would have been if I had not been there. I contacted Josh and sent him the documentation from my abortive attempts at patenting a cyborg body in New Zealand. From that point on, I was Chief Engineer. That’s when I met the really interesting characters. 
First, I met two people who remain friends to this day: A. and G.A. G.A. was an Indian graduate student who would later help me set up a social enterprise in India. G. was a good old Southern boy-turned-Army medic who would later become a de facto legal advisor due to past law school experience. These two people were the most mundane and least credentialed of those with whom I would interact.
I met a parade of strange people, but four are worth mentioning. The first was Dr. Sergio Canavero, the Italian surgeon attempting to perform the first human head transplant. He drew scorn from across the spectrum, but he was brilliant and utterly insane in the best way possible. He didn’t give a crap about naysayers and even politely replied to their critiques. Then came his collaborator, Prof. Xiaoping Ren. 
Prof. Ren was one of the first surgeons to reattach an amputated human hand, and he had labs at Loyola University Chicago and Harbin Medical University. Prof. Ren had a South Korean collaborator, C-Yoon Kim, who focused on replicating spinal nerve therapies in his lab at Konkuk University in Seoul. The last person worth mentioning here was separate from the rest: Phil Kennedy. He was a neural engineer who had electrodes implanted into his own brain to build a direct, invasive BCI. He later had to remove them due to surgical complications. 
Of these four, I went on to a more specific project with Prof. Ren and his group. I designed the first full-body prosthetic, a container to hold an animal's vital organs, inspired by science fiction like Ghost in the Shell and Robocop. I worked with G to help finalize the specific surgery for transposing the subject’s entrails, spine, and key organs into the artificial vessel, which we would fill with Ringer’s solution to simulate interstitial fluid. I designed the device, had them manufactured at a medical device prototyping company at my own expense, and had them sent to Prof. Ren’s lab.
Then, we got the results. We used a rodent model to start, but a blood clot entering the brain killed the rat after an hour. While this was not the result I wanted, it indicated that the surgery did not outright kill the animal with shock. The problem, it seemed, was life support. A more sophisticated artificial life support system, as well as a reliable BCI, was necessary to make it a truly closed-loop system. We submitted a conference paper to IEEE EMBC in 2017, held that year in Jeju, South Korea. This work was entirely independent of my day job, but I was nevertheless passionate about it.
Other things happened as the research wound down in 2017. We started receiving death threats from conspiracy theorists, and being frequently stalked (or worse).. We gained a healthy experience with various forms of self-defense, from fists to firearms. The lab where I worked was pivoting towards teaming humans and semi-autonomous systems, including drones, according to a local friend. Uncomfortable with this potential institutional direction, I focused on my exit. I wondered if the days of Rickover and those like him were long over. 
I kept in frequent touch with two people in New Zealand: a friend, who later turned out not to be one, and someone I’d given up on, who turned their life around in a positive way. I wanted to see them again, and I wanted to leave the ill-fitting suburban routine behind. The hostel-hopping backpacker lifestyle did not require much money, but to my more sheltered relatives and friends, it was simply not an option. I ignored such thoughts, for small pond fish cannot see the ocean’s raging surf. 
Rather than consign myself to a career of quiet desperation, I once more consigned myself to the open road. 
Crash Pad, Launchpad
Living in Maryland was a productive time for me, not only for research and reading but also for writing and ideation. Ideation, when brainstorming takes on a life of its own, is always the most exciting part of any project. While the routine caused its share of psychological crashes, it also served as the launchpad for several productive projects. The stranger-than-fiction twists in politics provided plenty of inspiration for writing as well.
Across the world, the Syrian Civil War continued drawing in every actor in the Middle East and beyond. There was a failed coup attempt against Erdogan in Turkey, funded by geopolitical rivals in the Gulf. The Qataris and Saudis sniped at each other through Sunni Islamic proxy groups in Yemen and Syria, with the UAE stepping in to secure ports and islands when it could. The grim Gulf nations were but another entry in the Middle East’s long, grim history. 
Such real-life horrors dwarfed the fictional ones. Lovecraft’s fictional history of the Middle East provided plenty of writing inspiration as well. For example, the most famous fictional dark tome of his universe, the Necronomicon, was written by an equally fictional Arab sage known as Abdul Alhazred (a nonsensical name in Arabic), who disappeared in broad daylight in ancient Syria. But reality was far sadder.
I had thought the 2014 General Election in New Zealand was a one-off oddity, some kiwi quirkiness. But the insanity of the 2016 US election dwarfed it. Hillary Clinton used the “pied piper” strategy, trying to direct the media so that she could run against the most repulsive candidate she could find: Donald Trump. The attention heaped on him by the media and campaign messaging in the primaries, coupled with rigging the Democratic primaries against Bernie, kneecapped the Democrats’ chances, even among former Obama voters. As a result, Clinton was unprepared for Trump winning the election. 
Then came the Russiagate farce. A few security state bureaucrats were worried Trump would change foreign policy (such as by improving relationships with Russia), though these fears turned out to be as non-existent as Trump’s manners. They hired a washed-up British spy to fabricate the Steele dossier, which was used to ‘prove’ the Russians had helped Trump with Facebook ads and controlled him through blackmail, along with other similarly outlandish conspiracy theories. The fact that Trump’s background (full of more mundane scams, swindles, dirty real estate deals, and dishonest dealings) contained enough dirt on its own seemed utterly lost on the political hacks and impish investigators.
The price of this debacle was a continued loss of faith in the institutions of government and security agencies. Former Iraq War advocates rebranded themselves as the “resistance” against Trump. Unfamiliar with the concept of a hostile bureaucracy, Trump bungled through whatever policies his establishment advisors put before him. One of these policies was continuing the Obama-era support of ultra-nationalist groups and outright Neo-Nazis in Ukraine, such as the Azov Battalion. Like they had for many other extremist groups in living memory, many in the security agencies cynically armed these groups, under the dubious belief that these extremists were more of a threat to the enemy and that it was acceptable to create tomorrow’s problems today. 
Just because a group hated the Russians did not mean they cared for the US. The Azov Battalion and its fellow travelers also hated Jews, Poles, Asians, Muslims, and a list of others. What made the Azov Battalion especially horrifying was their social media savvy, and they recruited white supremacists from around the world. The local Ukrainian oligarchs used such militias as muscle against the Russians and each other while playing outside actors to their advantage. The Canadian Deputy Prime Minister, Chrystia Freeland, is the proud descendant of Nazi collaborators, and she eagerly supported such groups alongside the soulless neoliberal creep, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. 
Similarly, Obama supported Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil (to counter the progressive Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva) and Narendra Modi in India (to maintain the country as a coding talent pool for Silicon Valley). But proxies often have their own agendas, and the grisly price of this support would directly affect my life a few years down the line—but that’s a horror for a different day.
While the 2016 geopolitical scene was as cruel as usual, I nevertheless continued my recreational reading. I continued with the latest Matthew Reilly books. I binged on Brandon Sanderson. I finished reading Liu Cixin’s Dark Forest and Death’s End. I enjoyed the Black Company by Glen Cook. I polished off the Broken Empire trilogy by Mark Lawrence. I read Peter Watts’ sequel to the amazing Blindsight, Echopraxia. I liked it enough to consider how to build some devices from the novel in real life, as it was very well-researched hard science fiction. Not every book has a bibliography of research journals, but I aspire to write a book like this myself. 
I wrote a few works in this period, mostly experimenting with new styles and tropes. In particular, I wrote a supernatural dark comedy thriller (Juvenalia) after fleshing out the premise with my friend R. K. I also worked on a Clark Ashton Smith-inspired novella (Lord of Broken Stars) and its sequel (Broken Stars). I started writing a fantasy detective series set in Ming Dynasty China, although I lost interest after a few chapters. 
I played some enjoyable games during this time: Dishonored 2, the 2016 Doom reboot, Mortal Kombat X, the rebooted XCOM series, Persona 5, and Assassin’s Creed Syndicate. As much as I enjoyed older franchises, a few new ones stuck out to me. I enjoyed SOMA, a survival horror game based around mind uploading and automation gone awry. The one that resonated with me, though, was Horizon Zero Dawn. 
The plot of Horizon involved robots, ecology, artificial intelligence, and memorable characters in a way I had not seen in a long time. The game mechanics, robot ecosystem, plot revelations, and the rest reminded me of Asimov and Golden Age science fiction in the best ways possible. Suffice to say, it was an optimistic (in many ways) game that stood out from the depressing real world and too many fictional dystopias to list. It sparked my interest in the solarpunk genre of speculative fiction, although it may not necessarily meet the criteria for inclusion in this genre. 
Not all of my gaming was electronic. I dove into my then-favorite tabletop roleplaying system, Pathfinder. At the time, the studio had released an “adventure path,” a series of premade modules, called Strange Aeons. Unsurprisingly, this was a Lovecraftian path. I never had a chance to run the whole thing, but each module was great reading. I bought hard copies of each one. I also ran a homebrew campaign inspired by Chrono Trigger, but intra-player drama derailed it. Little did I know how much the Pathfinder game system would become a fixture of my life in the coming year.
My time as a postdoc at the University of Texas-San Antonio TSA was both a crash pad and a launchpad. It was a preview of the life that awaited me if I followed a conventional, stable career. There were enjoyable aspects and consumer comforts, but the world would continue to roll on. I was unsatisfied with how little I had traveled, though it would have been far easier to do what my relatives, friends, and colleagues suggested. My artificial body was the first of several independent projects that tempted me towards hyperstition, or creating the future you want. What use was playing games, reading books, or imagining future technologies if I could create them instead?
A month after departing Aberdeen, I was traveling across New Zealand once more. 
The Amazing Human Pinball
The middle to the end of 2017 was the craziest, most frantic travel period in my life. I left my parents’ house with a suitcase and a laptop bag, expecting to spend a few weeks in New Zealand. I traveled across the North Island, stopping for a bit at Palmerston North. Throughout my trip, I applied for jobs online. I got an interview and an offer with a small company in Singapore. With the security of a job offer in hand, I continued a half-improvised trek around the world.
I left Palmerston North for Christchurch, where I met some of my old roommates. I stayed with them for a bit, meeting with my old faculty advisors and friends around town. After that, I flew to Seattle, where I met some friends from my roleplaying group. From there, I took a train to Vancouver, Canada, that film studio metro area in the Pacific Northwest. I traveled to Utah, where I met a friend from Delaware. I then flew home for the Fourth of July. I relaxed for a week before departing for South Korea.
My flight did not go directly to the conference in Jeju, IEEE EMBC 2017. Instead, I took a flight to Hong Kong, where I spent a night in the terminal before hopping on a flight to Jeju Island. I spent that night reading a translated collection of Liu Cixin short stories, including the namesake one: “Wandering Earth." I then arrived in Korea for the first time. I took a bus that crossed beneath the shadow of Mt. Halla, going from Jeju City to Seogwipo. 
Jeju City is on the north side of the island and is the site of the busy airport. Jeju Island had a sad, grim history due to the government crackdown during the Jeju Uprising in the late 1940s, which has led to the occasional unearthing of mass graves. This was hardly on my mind at the time since I was focused on visiting the tourist-focused city at the island’s south end, Seogwipo. 
I stayed at a hotel within walking distance from the convention center, a scenic structure overseeing the ocean. I checked in and met a few people who would become familiar faces. Interestingly, on the first day of the conference, I was fortunate enough to meet C-Yoon Kim in person. We met and coordinated his arrival frantically since he had another meeting back in Seoul. I still have the battered poster I presented, which certainly got its share of odd stares. 
The conference was interesting but relatively brief. My next challenge was getting to Singapore to start my new job. I booked a place online that was presented as a hostel. I flew to Shanghai, where I met some professors from Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University, including a renowned expert in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces, Prof. Cuntai Guan. The NTU faculty and I rushed through the airport when our flight was called, and I departed for Singapore.
That’s when the real trial started. Shortly after midnight, I arrived at the hostel on a vacant asphalt lot at the end of a road nestled between larger buildings. The establishment had metal shacks with rooms the size of closets, but that did not bother me. The “kitchen” and “laundry” were under a single open-air roof with metal sinks, coin-operated washers, shared refrigerators, and plenty of rats and roaches. Rent was about a thousand Singapore dollars a month, almost as much as a great flat in the US.
My first day of work was also an awakening. The company was actually several smaller startups owned by the same individual, all sharing space in a converted industrial park. I took the Singaporean Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) to get there and back, and I normally ate at the nearby hawker center. Such things were amazing to me since I craved the sheer range of food and spiciness. I heard a cab driver quip that Singapore had low wages and long hours, but neither were deal-breakers for the island where I now lived.
Living at the hostel led to a few interesting nightmares. Most of the other inhabitants were Indian, Bangladeshi, and Southeast Asian students and migrant workers. A Turkish guy was there for a few days, with whom I played and won an intense chess game. I stuck out pretty obviously. I washed my clothes in a rat-filled, coin-operated washing machine also used by dozens of other unlucky souls, so it smelled like sweat at all times, even with large amounts of detergent. I was lucky to find better accommodation afterward.
At work, I met a perfect justification of my practice of avoiding other American expatriates in a particularly obnoxious New Yorker, a caricature of every negative stereotype, who spread rumors about me around the office. Even beyond him, I noticed the place had a high turnover rate. After a few months, when an investor pulled out of the specific company I worked for, I was shown the door.
At this point, the countdown started. To stay in Singapore, I needed full-time employment. I applied online like a madman, to no avail. Fortunately, my living conditions had improved, and I was renting a room in a condo near Jurong East. It was right next to the MRT station, it had a gym, it had a pool, and it had a fully functional washing machine. 
I handed out physical copies of my resume all around Singapore’s tech startup hub, one-north. I knocked on doors, handed my resume to often befuddled office workers, and moved on to the next. I did this for a couple of days before getting results. After sliding a resume under a door, I heard the heavy footfalls of someone running up behind me. I turned to see a man who would become my coworker saying, “The boss wants to speak with you.” I chatted with the engineering manager, who is still a very good friend, and got a job offer soon after. That’s how I got a job at ST Engineering’s consumer technology spinoff, Innosparks. 
The travel spree in 2017 was not yet over. My job did not start until January of 2018, and I had been invited to visit a friend in rural New Zealand on behalf of a project to which I was donating time, money, and expertise. The project was systematically preserving decommissioned percussion pistols from the New Zealand Land Wars, several of which were held by a collector, to discern where they originated. Since I wanted to inspect the pistols physically, I had to travel there.
I took a long bus ride from Auckland to King Country, once the hub of the breakaway Maori King movement. The hills and rough terrain surrounding it made it a sanctuary, and it was essentially the New Zealand analog of Appalachia, right down to the crime and poverty. I stayed on a remote farm over an hour drive from the nearest town. I planned to stay only a few days, but these days would be quite restless.
Because the prior owner of the farm had been involved with local junkies and biker gangs, unsavory sorts still dropped by. I stayed with a friend away from the main house, but I still encountered a creep who peeked in my room and showed an unhealthy fascination with my laptop. I noticed him spying on me in different places around the property, such as when I jogged. This culminated when he paid an uninvited visit to the interior of my lodging. I can still picture it: meth-stained teeth, predatory grin, and a metal prybar in hand. Thinking quickly, I recalled one of the decommissioned pistols from the study, a percussion revolver. Despite being a useless wall-hanger unable to discharge, it nevertheless sent a message. After this commotion, he never bothered me again. 
Understandably, that experience deepened my fondness for percussion revolvers. These muzzle-loading pistols used black powder instead of modern gunpowder and had only a third of the kinetic energy of contemporary propellants. In the Victorian era, those shot by such arms were two or three times more likely to die of infection rather than directly from the gunshot wound. At the range at which these pistols became dangerous, melee weapons like swords, bayonets, and rifle butts were often more reliable and efficient ways to dispatch opponents. Therefore, many were designed to be heavy enough to function as clubs and bludgeons at close range. Even though mine could no longer discharge due to corrosion, it was still an effective metal club, slightly better than nothing. A modern thug would not know any of that, however. 
My adventure in New Zealand aside, I returned safely to Singapore at the end of December. At this point, I was ready to begin a regular job. It had been an adventurous, productive year. I had traveled to several countries across three continents, met old friends, made new ones, and risked my life to preserve artifacts relevant to indigenous history. If I had stayed in my old job, I would have been able to do none of this.
In the end, I learned a simple lesson: Choose hobbies that can save your life. 
Merlion Media Mashup
Many things helped me through the hardships I faced in Singapore, including reading and writing. At the suggestion of an Indian friend, I read Wings of Fire, the autobiography of one of the greatest Indians of the 20th century: Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, or A. P. J. Abdul Kalam for short. He was a fighter pilot, prolific scientist, president of India, father of India’s rocket program for both military missiles and space research, and an all-around astounding human being.
A. P. J. was born in poor, pre-independence India, and he ended up becoming perhaps its greatest son. At the height of the Cold War’s Space Race, he was on friendly terms with both the American and Soviet space agencies. He effectively ran two of India’s top research agencies at their inception, the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO, India’s analog of the American DARPA) and the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). He was a devout Muslim who was tolerant of all faiths and creeds. Despite his fame, he lived very simply. In the harsh conditions I faced in that dormitory in Singapore, I could definitely relate. 
A. P. J.’s heritage was also tangentially related to Singapore’s demographics. He was born in Tamil Nadu, which was once the seat of the Chola Empire. The Chola Empire had the longest continuous naval tradition in history, lasting from the time of Alexander the Great to the beginning of the Mongol conquests. The Empire’s cultural influence spread from the subcontinent to Sri Lanka to southern Thailand. As a result, there was a diaspora of Tamil-speaking Indian merchants across Southeast Asia. This is why Tamil was one of Singapore’s official languages, alongside English, Mandarin Chinese, and Malay. Perhaps, due to A. P. J., the Tamil thalassocratic tradition might one day reach the stars.
Back on Earth, I dove deep into podcasts. Since I had a long walk to the MRT station and then a long commute, I preferred media that I could listen to easily. I got my first smartphone in Singapore, a second-hand device I reluctantly left on. Instead of filling the phone with apps or mobile games, I used an old-fashioned MP3 player to listen to a range of podcasts. Since I was most invested in the Pathfinder system at the time, I listened to the big podcast names in the field, like “Glass Cannon.” A different Pathfinder podcast, one with a more personal tie, soon became my favorite. 
That podcast was the Sword of Nerdom’s City of Shadows campaign. The Game Master (GM) was a writing friend I had known for a decade. One day, I saw a link he posted. I listened to it on a whim and was transported to the dark, Gothic city of Strova. Unlike other campaigns, this one took place in a homebrew, low-magic, and human-dominated world, which kept it grounded. I even wrote a few pieces of fanfiction about it and helped flesh out a few aspects of the fictional world of Sjora. 
That fictional dark fantasy campaign helped me through the rough first few months in Singapore. The release of a new episode marked my favorite time of week after my own Pathfinder sessions. I visited the local Pathfinder Society, which organized live plays with short, stand-alone adventure modules almost every week, incorporating it into my routine. I would get up in the hours before dark, exercise, clean up, head into work, and arrive home over 12 hours later most nights (staying out roughly 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.). On Pathfinder nights, I would be out until midnight. 
I became more involved with the local literary scene, at least to a point. The largest literary event was the Singapore Writers Festival, which I attended in November of 2017. I was somewhat starstruck when I met Ken Liu, who had translated Liu Cixin’s The Three-Body Problem and other works and authored his own great material. The Festival was a great way to sell books, which were expensive for the average Singaporean (outside of the then-sizeable used book market). There was a Singapore-based speculative fiction magazine called LONTAR, but it folded (pun intended) shortly after I arrived. 
I did not write any novels during this time, but I wrote some solid short stories, including a few set in Sjora (“Slouching Towards Jianghu” being my first and favorite). These would later amount to over a novel’s length of writing with a few recurring themes and characters. They helped keep me sane when I was alone in an ultra-competitive foreign country without a social safety net. Getting through this time was more than enough to boost my confidence. 
Singapore went from a swampy slum to a super-city in a few decades. A. P. J. went from poverty and obscurity to international fame and fortune due to his persistence and brilliance. Singapore used sovereign wealth funds and civic trust funds to fund its infrastructure, strategic industries, and research. A. P. J. used his discipline and daring to complement his natural intellect. Both Singapore and A. P. J. rose from nothing to shine like stars. Singapore’s iconic Merlion, part lion and part mermaid, may be a recent icon, but all symbols have to start somewhere. Eventually, someone will take notice. 
The world does not care for us. Others will not be there to save us, and the universe can be even colder than a Gothic fantasy or cosmic horror story. This, however, should not prevent us from trying to reach our goals. It did not prevent me. At the end of 2017, I was on my own in a foreign country, out of a job by the whims of fate. Those whims could bring woe and weal, but the only thing certain was that they would shift. From a luxury apartment in Maryland to a migrant dormitory, a rented condo and a string of hostels, I had been to many places in 2017. My destination was never clear, but I succeeded, for a time, in escaping the Acela Corridor. 
As the following year would show, even the best circumstances can dramatically reverse. 
Salad Days in Singapore
The first day working at ST Engineering, I began processing the data from a prior project, a wearable device to detect falls in elders. By the second day, I had exceeded the performance of the study that was the source of our data. My manager was impressed, but as with all good things, this was not to last. 
Even as I passionately arrived at 6 a.m. and departed 11–12 hours later each day, I was running several other projects of my own initiative. The first of these is still fresh on my mind: the reverse engineering of antique Victorian-era New Zealand mechanical devices. While I originally hoped to acquire a range of antiques, I ended up with just two percussion pistols from the Maori Land Wars. I had almost died for one of these, so I was motivated to see the project through for at least these two pistols. I managed this process from thousands of kilometers away, sending the antiques to a specialized lab to disassemble them and make digital models. While at the lab, they were also analyzed by a military technology historian. This project would reap a different sort of return than profit, but a very valuable one. 
The second project brought me to work with researchers I contacted at the Jeju conference a few months into 2018. The primary limitation of my full-body prosthesis, as well as of current life support technology, was the problem of blood reoxygenation. In veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, a series of complex machines operated by a team of highly trained medical staff, acts as an artificial replacement circulatory system for the brain. The problem is that it has a ~50% patient mortality rate (from both the procedure and prior complications), and ~40% of the survivors have brain damage. Not a good combination if I wanted to completely replace the heart and lungs with mechanical counterparts. Thus, blood reoxygenation had to be addressed first.
Smarter, better-funded people than me attacked the problem by trying to mimic how the lungs worked with cutting-edge artificial biomaterials. The problem was that these would clog with platelets and cease working after a few weeks at the latest. They were expensive to make, and it was difficult to scale them to large volumes. After digging through the conference proceedings and re-watching some science fiction (James Cameron’s The Abyss), I had an idea. More importantly, it was a cheap idea for me.
During the Cold War, the US Navy looked for ways to keep divers underwater for longer periods. Additionally, there was always a push for artificial blood to replace the need for donated blood, with some questionable implementations approved abroad since the 1970s. Some of the more promising artificial oxygen carriers were perfluorocarbons (PFCs), which were biocompatible (no adverse reactions), protected against ischemia (damage from the sudden reoxygenation of deoxygenated tissue), cheap to make, and helpful in sustaining donated organs. In The Abyss, a rat (and later a character) breathes in PFCs as a form of liquid breathing. The problem? They are a single-use item, a glorified pharmaceutical at best.
My solution was a closed-loop PFC injection and recovery system. We would inject PFC nanocapsules into peripheral blood vessels, then separate them using a combination of mechanical and non-tactical means (such as optical or focused ultrasound). I contacted a team in Germany working on PFCs, starting with the corresponding author from one of their papers. The author liked my idea so much that I held regular meetings with the team (often evenings or mornings my time). The head of the team stated that in his decades of working on nanocapsules, my idea was novel to him. I helped the team design experiments and find resources (often in other branches of their university). This work is still ongoing.
The third project was related to my brain-computer interface problem: how can we reliably stimulate deep into the brain without invasive electrodes? Implanting devices into the brain can result in scar-tissue buildup, electrode degradation, and a gradual loss of coherent signal. These problems can be alleviated with biocompatible (but experimental and expensive) materials and coatings, but even in the best-case scenario, implantation still requires brain surgery. If one was to be a brain in a jar (my dream career), one needed something highly reliable, highly precise, highly scalable, and highly proven. In short, I needed safe, non-invasive deep brain stimulation. 
I compared and contrasted three primary technologies. The first was electrical stimulation, which comes in many forms: direct current, alternating current, random noise, and later others. However, this requires large electrodes to safely dissipate power. The second technology was transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which uses an electromagnet to induce a current. The problem was that TMS interferes with other electronic systems and the required apparatus was the size of a bookshelf. The third technology was a focused ultrasound, which uses low-power beams focused toward a particular point. I will delve further into this topic later. 
The fourth project was a mission to fill a cultural void in the world. With the speculative fiction magazine LONTAR on ice, I stepped up to found a new magazine: Ombak. The name (meaning ‘wave’) was suggested by a Malay friend at ST Engineering. Many of Southeast Asia’s countries had conservative governments with strict censorship laws, preventing discussions and depictions of certain topics. Thus, we launched Ombak as an underground, independent publication.
We learned things as we went along. By “we,” I mean writing friends, both local and international. Ombak had a Singaporean lead editor, who later became a successful board game designer. We had an illustrator from the Philippines who depicted a scene from our favorite story in each issue (like Weird Tales and old pulp magazines). We had a webmaster from Laos, with whom correspondence was always an adventure. We had another top editor from the US, my partner in weird fiction, R. K. We specifically sought weird fiction, in the Clark Ashton Smith sense (often with unexpected twist endings). 
We got submissions from Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines, India, and their global diasporas. Many of our writers preferred pen names because they feared public disclosure of their real names. None of our stories covered anything excessively gory, explicit, or the like, but we had a few mentions of LGBT minor characters. Sadly, this was enough to end up in deep, deep trouble in some parts of the world. Thus, we took it seriously.
My days at ST Engineering were more pleasant versions of how I had lived before. For a time, my life seemed to expand beyond my initial expectations. I took Mandarin lessons with a local tutor. I visited a grad school friend in Hanoi to discuss sustainable urban design. I was hired to tutor a coworker’s nine-year-old son in English comprehension and math (a task for which I adapted and improvised a tabletop roleplaying game, with much success). I provided worldbuilding ideas to a coworker who wrote a trilogy of superhero novels (the Ordinary Oliver trilogy, if you want to look it up). I concluded each day with a meandering walk around Bukit Batok, never taking quite the same route twice.
Few people of Singapore knew about the mad scientist among them, the strange ang moh that collected seemingly random discarded items for tinkering or repair. On one of my walks, I met J. C., who would become the best part of my time there. I found a mousy girl digging through refuse near a bakery, pulling out a discarded box of pastries. I checked to see if there were any others, and she offered me what she found. That was how I found out about her food rescue and her need to salvage edible food discarded due to appearance or (perceived) lack of freshness. I learned she was a chemistry graduate and lab technician who spent time in the nearby library. She was like me, in the obsessive dumpster-diving ways that mattered. My strangeness was intimidating to her at first, like many people. However, she was one of the most amazing people I had met, hands down.
However, things at ST Engineering were not going well. I had mentioned some of my projects, but they seemed too theoretical for the conservative management. After the first few months, the wearable medical device was canceled due to decisions from above. Then, our founding manager left. Engineers began to trickle out the door. As we were micromanaged from above, the exodus continued, and not even a new manager could prevent the inevitable: the Innosparks engineering lab was to be shuttered. I resigned over a year after getting an offer for a year-long research position at Jeju National University. My interest in ultrasound brought me there, but it would take me to stranger places in the time to come.
One need not be an expert in acoustics to hear what life is trying to tell you. 
Jeju Gothic
I intended to stay in Korea for a year, but fate had other plans. I felt some amusement that the new position was at Jeju National University, where I had presented a few years before. The island was beautiful, scenic, and relaxing compared to mainland Korea, and it was the destination of the world’s busiest air corridor (pre-pandemic). Before it became a tourist hotspot, it had been the site of a grisly series of events.
The island had been the site of two uprisings in the last century. The first occurred after the Sam-il Movement, or March 1 Movement, in Korea, then occupied by Imperial Japan. The rebels used spears, matchlock muskets, and whatever else they could arm themselves with. The Imperial Japanese replied with machine guns and artillery. The second uprising was in 1948, shortly after Korea was partitioned into the North and South. This provoked a nationalist backlash that spiraled into an armed uprising. 
The Truman Administration did not care about the specific politics, ascribing the uprising to communist plots (despite intelligence that said otherwise). As such, they brought down the hammer. The US-backed dictator of the South, Syngman Rhee, launched a bloody reprisal campaign consisting of death squads wreaking havoc across the island. This pointless, dirty war directly set the stage for the Korean War since the North Korean leadership believed they needed to move quickly before anti-communists could overrun the peninsula. A third of the villages on the island were wiped out, and mass graves of men, women, and children continue to be found even today. Large portions of the island were overgrown and reclaimed by nature, although the traces of these uprisings remain. 
The island’s economy transformed into a tourist one after the release of Winter Sonata. Because Jeju was South Korea’s only province with special autonomy, it became home to all sorts of tourist traps, like the adorable Teddy Bear Museum or raunchy Jeju Loveland. Its natural beauty was also worthy of being a UNESCO-recognized site. The island held South Korea’s largest peak (Hallasan/Mt. Halla), a series of lava tubes (Manjanggul Lava Tube is the only one that visitors can walk through), Asia’s only waterfall that flows directly into the ocean (Cheonjiyeon), and the bowl-shaped caldera of an extinct volcano (Seongsan Ilchulbong). It became South Korea’s favorite destination, but each year it also draws visitors from China, Japan, and beyond. 
I was one such visitor in early 2019. I was well-aware of the horrid history, largely because I had dived into the politics of Cold War Korea at the National Library of Singapore. To me, Jeju was not a gaudy tourist attraction. It was a somber cemetery, a monument of uncaring nature and grim history. Jeju was once known as a paradise of abundant food, wealth, and romance. It was still a paradise, but one with a Gothic vibe, at least in a literary sense. I could feel it even during my daily routine. 
Before I arrived, my future lab mate found me a furnished apartment near campus. It was in a small village just up the hill from Jeju National University. A grad student in the lab I would work in picked me up from the airport, and I moved in. My future lab mates, grad students working for the primary professor in the lab, suggested I shop at a particular place to finish furnishing the apartment. 
Much to my surprise, Korea now had its own native big-box chain of stores, E-Mart. There were three on Jeju Island, but the one in Jeju City was easily within reach of the bus I occasionally caught from campus. The stores were smaller than their American (or even New Zealand) counterparts but more comprehensive in merchandise. For example, they had hardware, groceries, and consumer goods instead of requiring three different stores for each.
My ‘commute’ was simply walking up and down the hill each day to reach the lab. I walked by the low, stone walls that once crisscrossed the island. There were cairn-like structures, ancient grave markers, at the center of fields and green patches. There were scenic backroads near where I lived, although some were covered with litter. My commute went down a small street with two convenience stores, through what was then the main campus. From there, I crossed campus to reach the building where I worked. The structure was built decades ago, and I walked up four stories to reach my lab. Most of my work involved data processing, and I worked on a nice desktop.
While there, I taught my first two graduate classes. The first was an introduction to neural engineering, where I used a consumer-grade EEG headset to demonstrate how to build an EEG-based BCI. The second was on machine learning for signal processing. I detailed and demonstrated a suite of classification algorithms and the sort of problems they could address. I created Python demos to demonstrate the capabilities of open-source software. I also visited the main sights, climbed Hallasan, scuba-dived, and learned some basic Korean. 
In terms of research, I had a productive year. Three of my papers were published. One was on optimizing focused ultrasound and magnetic stimulation for brain-to-brain interfacing. The second was a review paper on EEG-based drowsiness (suggested by a student from my first class). The third published the results of my New Zealand militaria study, a long-time passion project finally reaching its conclusion. There was also a conference paper investigating the feasibility of synthetic setae (which geckos use to climb walls) for transducer attachment. Last was a functional analysis of the first mechanical medical tool, the hand-cranked osteotome. 
I was also productive in my recreational writing. I completed a sequel to my earlier horror action comedy Juvenalia. Juvenalia was about evil creatures inspired by children’s shows, nostalgia, and immaturity. The sequel, Juvenalia, Too, focused on sexuality and transformation, incorporating similarly nightmarish monsters and a mostly new cast. I also churned out a regular tide of short stories each month. I started a personal tradition of writing at least two pieces of flash fiction each month. I got back in touch with the Ombak team from the prior year, since we wanted to continue. As the sole funder, I budgeted tightly to afford it. With our initial run a success, we released a second issue of Ombak. 
I did a fair bit of traveling as well. I visited J. C. and other friends in Singapore, staying in a Housing and Development Board (HDB) apartment for the duration of my trip. I presented at a local conference at the convention center in Seogwipo, the same place as the conference where I’d started my time in Asia. I met with S. and G. in Seoul, where we met with C-Yoon to discuss cyborg bodies, head transplants, brain cryogenic studies, and other topics. I even traveled to the US twice, once in the summer to visit my parents, and again in November to present at an IEEE EMBS conference.
That second trip became a source of drama. I had an earlier disagreement with a particular faculty member over a potential grad student from Vietnam. The student was a hard worker and one of the reasons the EEG drowsiness review paper happened. However, the faculty member sought a reason to reject him despite his hard work and my defense of him. I should have seen that as a hint of things to come. 
I was told that I would be able to travel to a conference and be reimbursed. I should have gotten that in writing. I was repeatedly refused reimbursement for the IEEE conference after the fact. Living as precariously as I was, this was a howitzer strike to my finances. I had been surviving on convenience store salads and an occasional Subway sandwich. Now, I had to (literally) tighten my belt even further. This only increased my resolve to return to Singapore a little ahead of schedule, especially as winter set in.
Fate intervened once more. Towards December 2019, a little virus called COVID-19 was first making its rounds. I booked a flight to return to Singapore at the end of January. My timing turned out to be excellent. I managed to make it to Singapore right before the first wave of border closures and lockdowns. It was a shame I left Jeju under such circumstances since I otherwise thoroughly  enjoyed it. 
As was a recurring theme in my life: don’t get too comfortable.
A Respite Before the Plunge
Before we dive into the nightmare that was 2020, I would like to take stock of how things were going around the world. This was the last year before the pandemic and the subsequent ‘new normal,’ with all the unpleasantness that entails. However, I would like to summarize many of the events leading to the pandemic. They provide context for much of the insanity of the following years. Globalization and financialization have created grotesque inequality in the US, China, Europe, India, and elsewhere. The global supply system is far more fragile than many think. The precarity that once defined the Global South, the developing world, extends increasingly to what was once the developed world. Having traveled the world, I’d now understood what this meant. 
In the US, the culture war is in full swing as the professional managerial class (PMC) merges with Bush Jr.-era figures in the Democratic Party. Since Wikileaks and Snowden, they’ve dropped all pretense of caring about freedom of speech. In fact, since 2012, they’ve grown increasingly comfortable with the idea of the government, security services, intelligence agencies, and corporations explicitly collaborating against “disinformation.” These are the same people who lied the country into the Iraq War and who keep lying about Afghanistan, Syria, and Yemen, so the irony is rich (and alarming). I’d seen the outside, so I recognized the partisan traps set by the media echo chambers back home. 
The PMC sees Trump’s election as “proof” that the media must be controlled, especially “rogue actors” like Wikileaks. Of course, there is little trust in these institutions for good reason: Cable news increasingly lowers its standards to compete with the 24/7 online model, and the remainder of corporate organs copy the template Fox News pioneered decades before. Of course, the distrust in these institutions is only a natural reaction to the general public realizing they are untrustworthy. The medical system’s relationship with most poorer Americans is primarily one of predatory exploitation (due to insurance companies and drug prices bankrupting people), so audiences are ready to believe any story painting Big Pharma as the bad guys. As with nature, conflagrations follow droughts. 
Next comes China, the world’s next most important economy. Inequality in China is bad, although the leadership is trying to focus on a domestic consumer base. The Chinese Belt and Road Initiative and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization have achieved something approaching mainstream awareness but are quickly dismissed by most Western outlets. The fact that the Chinese government is able to materially improve citizens’ living standards (and gets a huge boost in nationalism as a result) both terrifies and inspires the Western elites, who want to copy the totalitarian model. Social credit systems are being floated, both locally and on a larger scale. China looms large in politics and economics, and this does not change.
In seeking to escape from a dreary reality, I planned an adventure novel set in South Asia. In India, Modi’s government nearly stumbled into a nuclear war with Pakistan. The two countries have a few border skirmishes that escalate into aerial engagements, and they came alarmingly close to a nuclear exchange. I remembered closely because my novel outline was about adventurers seeking ancient secrets in the Indus Valley, racing an evil terrorist cult that tried to start a war between India and Pakistan to cover their path. It was a little too close to reality for comfort, so I shelved it. 
Even New Zealand is hit by bad events, one right out of a horror story. Down in Christchurch, a racist white supremacist loser murders 51 people. The terrorist uses illegal weapons, but the Arden government passes firearms regulations that disproportionately hurt the rural poor (especially Maori). Such laws proved ineffective in the past but are passed to appease the country’s own PMC. A raft of civil rights violations (including expanding domestic government surveillance and the ability to take down websites on a whim) flies through New Zealand’s Parliament building, nicknamed the Beehive. Such legislation was rightfully mocked during John Key’s tenure, but now the intelligence agencies get a blank check. In short, the terrorist gets what he wants, expanding the class war disguised as a culture war. Similarly, journalists report he may have been trained by Ukraine’s infamous Neo-Nazi militia, the Azov Battalion. The bad foreign policy only continues. 
Along the border with Ukraine and Russia, the US continues supplying heavy weapons to the Ukrainian military and paramilitary groups. Among them is the openly white supremacist neo-Nazi Azov Battalion, which uses social media to recruit “fellow travelers” from the US, Europe, Australia, and beyond. Their ethos is not only anti-Russian, but also anti-Semitic, anti-Polish, anti-Asian, anti-Roma, anti-Muslim, and anti-everyone else. Along with other groups, they act as the muscle for local oligarchs, who play both the West and Russia to their own advantage. Trump continues Obama’s policy of training, arming, and supporting these groups. Nothing has been learned from prior attempts to use extremist groups against a rival power. However, there are strangely bright points, at least for a time. 
In South Korea, Trump’s initial attempt to meet with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un meets popular support. Many South Koreans feel such a meeting could benefit them, as mainland China had boycotted South Korean businesses in 2017 after the US deployed THAAD (a missile defense system) on the peninsula. South Korean businesses want access to North Korea’s rare earth supply (estimated to be a third of the size of China’s total reserves) and cheaper labor. North Korea’s leadership wants South Korea’s capital and access to markets. 
The idea of officially ending the Korean War, perhaps even having North Korea managed as a special province of South Korea (not unlike Jeju) while keeping their nuclear weapons under joint control (with international observers, including the US), is seriously considered. However, John Bolton’s involvement torpedoes such talks, despite the potential boon to the US from diversifying its sources of strategic rare earth minerals amid rising tensions with China. This squanders the goodwill the US previously earned. The talks end ignobly, like a punchline from a political skit. 
I’d seen plenty of things before, but not a pandemic. Many Asian countries learned their lessons from SARS almost two decades earlier, unlike the US and EU. Singapore, Vietnam, and South Korea are among these countries, putting strict quarantine protocols in place. These protocols are responsible for their initial success with the pandemic, but there are variables even they do not account for. Given the frequency of air travel, it was inevitable that the virus would spread. Since we now have the internet and mobile devices, it is perhaps fortunate that the pandemic happened now rather than even a decade earlier. 
Even the best-laid plans can go to hell, and right to hell they went. 
A Year to Die For
I almost died trying to find refuge in audacity. For a time, I sought funding to commercialize my medical device ideas. In parallel, I knew I needed more conventional employment. I took a job with a startup company whose offer I had declined in December, just a month earlier. I physically marched to their office and asked if they still needed someone. Fortunately for me, they did.
I started in March 2020. I got private health insurance in case I needed a follow-up after a case of minor heartburn. The first month was all right, and I focused on improving a sound classifier system. I went out for lunch each day with my new coworkers, getting used to my new routine. I helped my friend in India, S., set up a business aimed at improving the lot of poor workers in West Bengal. A few weeks into the new year, however, the government implemented a full corona lockdown.
Officially, the lockdown was called the ‘circuit breaker.’ It was meant to be a month-long period that minimized the need for Singaporeans to meet with each other. For almost a month, I worked from home. Some of the spread was happening in migrant worker dormitories, where poor workers lived in close proximity with each other. According to that logic, I designed a system and prototype for computer-aided auscultation, a stethoscope connected to a smartphone that would detect the irregular breathing characteristic of respiratory illness. Sadly, the device did not fit into the diagnostic workflow that emerged during that period.
Since I was physically separated from friends, I caught up on video gaming. In particular, I played Doom Eternal, gathering most of the collectibles in my first playthrough. I read the latest Matthew Reilly novel as well. I planned out the next three major projects on which I would spend my free time, money, and effort for the remainder of the year. These included a prototype for a consumer-grade transducer for transcranial focused ultrasound, a micro-transducer for the acoustofluidic separation of oxygen-carrying nanocapsules from blood, and the third issue of Ombak Magazine. 
The first of these, which I called the ClearMind, was intended as an open-source computer-brain interfacing system. At the time, I was concerned about companies in the neural engineering space stimulating the brain through software that was proprietary and closed. Hobbyists in the EEG-based BCI community created their own open-source hardware, so I wanted something that would close the loop and non-invasively send information back into the brain. I chose the method of focused ultrasound. 
After a conversation with an expert in the field, I decided on a course of action. I planned to commission a prototype device based on specifications from a paper published a few years prior. Then, I would send the device to their lab for a full safety analysis. With ultrasound, there were many potential hazards: cavitation, hemorrhaging the brain, electrocution from the driver circuit, and others. We wanted a test module to see whether it was remotely safe for widespread (and potentially amateur) use. 
My collaborators and I ended up sourcing a component directly from a company that no longer made them (outside of special orders). We had it sent to his house in the US and then to a subcontractor in New Zealand to attach the driver circuit. From there, it was sent back to the researcher’s house, where it would undergo tests in a garage lab (due to lockdown). The project took almost the entire year, but it was successfully delivered.
The second project, which I called the Blutsanger, was the latest iteration of my artificial lung concept. Since a physical filter would rapidly clog if exposed to human blood and our nanocapsules were twice as dense, we used ultrasound to separate the capsules from blood. This principle, “acoustic tweezers,” has been used to separate chemicals in industry for decades. The advantage was that we could separate the nanocapsules and blood without physical contact. The disadvantage was that it required a specialized microelectronic device and a special driving circuit. 
Our device started as a post on Freelancer.com. From there, I met with a chemical engineer in Italy who found a local startup for outsourcing production. I provided monthly updates (and payments) to ensure the device was properly manufactured and shipped. In October, it safely arrived in our collaborators’ chemistry lab in Germany. The device had undergone a few modifications from the original specifications due to supply chain shortfalls towards the end of 2020. A single obstacle remained. 
Because of the high frequencies involved (and the risk of destructive feedback), I needed an electrical engineer to design a custom circuit for the device. After the ordeal of finding a manufacturer, paying for it, and shipping it, I wasn’t about to let an electronics problem stop me. An Indian electrical engineer suggested a circuit design that formed the basis for what was implemented in Germany. The device was completed, but I never imagined I might need it one day.
The third project was my attempt to raise morale among many in the writing community. The year 2020 sent many writers spiraling into depression. I wanted Ombak Magazine to lift the spirits of the handful of people that knew it existed. We opened for submissions, selected our top stories, paid the authors and staff, and released the magazine on time. This was more than many other publications could do, but we had practice working remotely across continents.
In the background, economic disaster struck the world. Financial distress intensified political polarization, especially with the US presidential election. The final call between the two senile geriatrics came down to about 42,000 votes in swing states, less than a percent of a polling error. Because of the Russiagate farce and selective reporting on the Hunter Biden laptop, the usual suspects exploited a lack of trust in the results. On the other side, the victors left little to be confident in, as they were establishment hacks about as inspiring as expired food.
I was involved with a few other projects. I completed a pathway with a local Toastmasters International Club while acting as the club’s Vice President of Public Relations. One successful project was compiling a virtual archive of historic machines. Another was the commencement of an app for selling traditional textiles in India. My collaborators and I started trying to fabricate a water membrane, an electrospun sheet that could reportedly harvest up to 10 gallons of water per hour from the atmosphere, but the logistics proved to be a nightmare. Despite all of this, the worst part of the year was at the end of November. 
Fate saved the best of 2020 for last. Startup companies do not have the capital of larger firms, so they are disproportionately affected. Because I was the new guy and foreigner at a startup during the pandemic, I was the first to go. Fortunately, I had already settled the debts for my projects. I was unfazed and hoped to simply look for a job in December. The worst part was that a week after I stopped working, I became acutely aware of my own mortality. 
It started with a pain in my chest. I ignored it for most of the day, doing intense cardio jogging up Singapore’s hills with a weighted backpack. I visited a friend on Nanyang Technological University’s campus, but the pain soon grew more intense. At first I thought it was heartburn, but I visited a doctor anyway. He thought it might be a heart attack. The ECG showed nothing, but he was adamant I visit the emergency room of a nearby hospital. I went to one in Jurong East, where I was in for an unpleasant surprise.
I thought the trip would be short, so I did not bring books, reading materials, or even a phone. I expected they would admit me to the ER, give me some proton pump inhibitors for acid reflux, and discharge me. Instead, they took a chest x-ray and found that my right lung had deflated like a popped balloon. This was my introduction to spontaneous pneumothorax. They wheeled me to the operating table and got to work.
Now, I had previously made it a point to avoid going to the hospital outside of normal business hours since the most experienced physicians prefer normal daytime hours. Those pulling the night shifts were new, with less experience. They were undertaking an operation to jam a tube into my chest, which would connect to a device to reinflate my lung. I worried it would be amateur hour in my chest. 
Thankfully, it was not. It was past midnight when I was wheeled back to the emergency department, and I tried to force myself to sleep. Though it was a weekday, it was a busy, noisy part of the hospital. I had no blanket, no pillow, and no way to contact my local friends. The following morning, they took an x-ray again, gave me some porridge, and lent me a laptop. I emailed the people I considered to be my closest friends in Singapore. 
That night, I was wheeled to a recovery ward. The lung was fully re-inflated, and doctors took the tube out. This was utopian compared to what I had been through. It turned out that a visitor had arrived. I had suspicions about who it was that would drop by after I had been lying on a potential deathbed. It was J. C., the most amazing person I knew, someone I definitely wanted to keep in my life. 
I was discharged the following morning and returned to my apartment. I caught up on emails and on everything that had occurred while I was out. Thankfully, my private insurance covered the costs. I began job hunting again and even got an offer from another startup. Excitedly, I asked J. C. to marry me. She accepted, making me the happiest man on the galactic cluster.
The first month of 2021 was a slap in the face, adding insult to injury. The Singaporean government declined my work pass application because the salary of my job offer was too low for someone of my credentials and age. As the government was trying to encourage companies to hire local talent, the bar had been raised while I was out. In the most recent game of musical chairs, I was the odd one out. 
That said, I nearly found success in other places. I tried academic and research positions and received another offer only for the same thing to happen. I would rather work for less, but the government had made its position clear. Due to doctors’ orders, I could not fly for another three months. I celebrated Chinese New Year and my birthday with J. C., but my funds and savings were running low. 
At the end of March 2021, I threw in the towel. I gave away, sold, or donated my possessions. I said my goodbyes as I prepared for a bitter trip home. I had to fly from Singapore to Amsterdam to Philadelphia, having just recovered from a lung collapse in the middle of a global pandemic of a respiratory virus. During each 16-hour flight, I never imagined that I might one day need my own artificial lung. Life has a way of moving in ways you don’t expect. 
Don’t move how others expect you to.
Return to Zero
I started April of 2021 in the place where I began: my parents’ house. I had gone from being the man of the house to a wreck in the guest room. I was irritable, physically wrecked, emotionally exhausted, and financially hit. It was not all bad, however. My brother lived across the street, and my mother prepared coffee for us every morning. These were regular meetings for my immediate family, save my sister and her fiancé, who lived out in the Rockies. It was during these times that Stoicism helped me. 
In particular, I read about Marcus Porcius Cato, better known as Cato the Younger. He was born wealthy but lived an austere, ascetic lifestyle for philosophical reasons. He was a man of honor and integrity, a rarity in the last days of the Roman Republic. He opposed Julius Caesar throughout his rise to power, eventually battling him on the losing side of a civil war. Cato took his life instead of allowing Caesar to capture him, memorializing himself as an icon of Roman Stoicism and virtue in the face of overwhelming odds.
The story of Cato the Younger has been retold throughout the centuries. While Dante’s Divine Comedy is the most famous, Joseph Addison’s 1713 play about Cato was very influential during the American Revolution. As the themes involve a republic rising against a tyrant, the story resonated with the Patriots. In a popular (but untrue) story, Nathan Hale paraphrased the play when he said, “I regret that I have but one life to give for my country.” Similarly, Patrick Henry referenced the play: “Give me liberty or give me death.” In this way, Stoic virtue motivated the American Revolutionaries.
I did not have any challenge as grand as Cato or the American Revolution, but I did not want to relapse to old habits. As I was still recovering from my pneumothorax, I began to walk long distances. I had a series of routes I would take around the neighborhood. Through small talk, I eventually came to know many of our neighbors, new and old, better than my parents and brother did. I eventually walked six miles a day, then ten, and even over 20 on some days. This continued for almost a year, even on the hottest summer days.
Walking was not my only daily exercise. I biked from two to six miles per day, depending on whether or not it was an endurance day. As it got warmer, my brother opened the pool in his backyard. I jumped in every morning, even if the sun had not yet risen. I acted as his unofficial pool boy, skimming it at least four times a day (before and after my morning and afternoon swims) and scraping algae off the sides. In addition, I pulled weeds and landscaped as necessary. My brother was kind enough to let me play some of his video games, like Ghost of Tsushima, Cuphead, and others. 
My daily routine was to wake up, exercise, and eat a big breakfast. I accomplished what I had to in the morning and then had brunch (often smaller than breakfast) before heading out on a walk. I would come back and do some martial arts and reaction drills before stretching. I would not eat anything from brunch until breakfast the following day. In time, I added a long walk during the evening. I enjoyed walking before trash day, often scavenging appliances to try and repair. I ended up using them as parts for other projects or donating them to local thrift stores. Having lived at the bottom, I had seen enough of people carelessly wasting things. I wanted to do what J. C. would. 
While I was separated from J. C., I checked in daily and tried to talk to her at least once a week. I did the same for my other friends and business associates. I set up a corporation in the US with a friend from college so that we could apply for research grants and manage projects. In addition, I helped S. and my former manager from ST Engineering set up a company in India for a full social enterprise. We had some difficulties due to the nightmarish Indian bank bureaucracy, but we managed to accomplish it.
During this time, I used every angle I could to find work. I applied to jobs in Singapore, the US, and elsewhere. The required salary issue continued to thwart my attempts to return to J.C., who was still studying in Singapore. Through a politically active friend, I got a gig as a poll worker during the primaries and the state governor’s election. I used the funds from the first gig to buy my first 3D printer, which I used to prototype a series of devices and inventions. My personal favorite was the Skysweeper, a rocket trawler used to capture and dispose of small space debris. It was robust enough to survive being fired out of a .38 revolver while successfully deploying a net behind it. 
I networked through another group, the Ronin Institute, a group of eccentric international citizen scientists. I appeared every week to deliver puns to the math and physics groups. I met some interesting people there, such as a person who headed the GSA during the Bush Sr. Administration and was also an advisor for Bob Dole’s 1996 campaign. I gave monthly short chats called Lightning Talks on a variety of my inventions and concepts, which are still on YouTube. I covered everything from space debris capture (including how the prototypes were tested), a safer (for animals) tranquilizer gun, a rescue-line-carrying rocket launcher pistol for astronauts (based on a similar Victorian device carried by British ships), a software protocol for synthetic telepathy (based on my prior research), and a self-contained opto-electric propulsion system for relativistic micro-spacecraft (based on a novel type of energy generation). I was no Cato, but I did put intellectual pursuits and ascetic living in a high position. 
The poll worker connections got me my first job back in the US. The leader of a local political party noticed me and suggested I work for a cybersecurity company that was looking for someone with an AI background. I was hired as a contractor, and I impressed my supervisor with the demonstrations I deployed for him. While I was not an expert on all aspects of cybersecurity, I worked to modularize the project so that we could systematically outsource each component to someone who was. 
Despite my separation from J. C., I was adapting to my circumstances. I did not have everything I wanted, and the things that annoyed me remained. The thing I loathed most was cable television, the psychological toxic waste pump that was always on at my house. I never watched it, but it was an unwelcome bit of background noise. I did my best to avoid it, but it often put my parents in a foul mood (as it was designed to do). Having enough things to deal with and a far broader perspective than I grew up with, I had grown past it. Sadly, many of those around me had not. 
One day in late December 2021, I woke up to find a tick burrowed into a cut on my chest and my glasses broken. It was like the universe was reminding me: do not get too comfortable. A few days later, I was made aware of some possible financial strain at my job. J. C. was also finishing her studies, and she was looking for somewhere to study pharmacy. During a particularly dramatic holiday season, I made my next major decision. 
Like Cato, I was going to uproot myself for a higher cause. 

Unexceptional After All
During this time, my social circle included many people who were politically active around the US and the world. I agree with the observation that both major parties in the US have different flavors of American exceptionalism as their ideologies of choice, regardless of how divorced from reality they are. The form of ideology that dominated after 9/11 was the jingoistic idea that the country could do no wrong. The second form was that the US was uniquely sinful, a wretched, irredeemable land responsible for the world’s ills. My view is simply that the US has its positives and negatives, like other nations. What makes our current elites quite terrifying is how truly isolated from reality they are as the lower rungs of the current oligarchy.
Oddly enough, this statement would probably elicit agreement among the bases of both main parties and independent voters. However, the donor class has long used ideology to divide the larger public. As detailed in Thomas Frank’s The People, No, the original populist movement was a union of the rural and urban poor that transcended skin color. Even within living memory of the Civil War and the end of slavery, the aristocrats of that era supported segregation and eugenics in order to cynically divide and conquer. Now that more wealth has been transferred upwards, they’re once again using the same tricks.
Their favored vehicle is the raft of toxic identity politics that arose in the 1990s. Despite Sokal and many others discrediting them, they were among the most well-funded humanities at many universities. Unlike prior social studies that focused on class, these new anti-humanities (as I call them) focus on an ever-shifting kaleidoscope of identity labels and insular jargon. Thanks to cynical marketing by marketing and human resources consultants, they got out into the wider society. 
This serves the interests of the oligarchs in multiple ways. For one, moral panics are always lucrative and they provide great excuses for getting rid of potentially disruptive employees (like those talking about unions and labor rights). Another is that the members of the credentialed classes use them to eliminate rivals, such as by limiting tenure track positions in academia. Peter Turchin would definitely ascribe such competition to “elite overproduction”, a problem also present in Singapore, South Korea, and New Zealand. These parasitic fools are doing their best to try and divide the country by skin color once more. Cynical examples include defining the idea of a “colorblind” society as racist, gutting programs for gifted students in San Francisco, and separating coworkers and students by ethnicity into “affinity groups.” They would rather bring back segregation than pursue policies that would materially improve conditions for the vast majority of the country (and even reap the political windfall of that).
I will tell a story I encountered in the 2021 governor’s race in New Jersey, a deep blue state where the incumbent governor very narrowly lost. A full-on loss occurred that same year in deep blue Virginia, giving the opposition a template to copy in the coming elections. The reason for the loss was an attempt to push racist identity politics in schools and propose the removal of programs for gifted students, rightfully horrifying parents (notably including immigrant parents). This helps keep rich mediocrities protected from capable, working-class competition. 
Two New Jersey friends of mine, a very liberal interracial couple who are both teachers, pulled the lever for the Republican Party for the first time. The reason for this was a series of school events at which their children were told to sort themselves by ethnicity. They also experienced a series of patronizing lectures from peers about how interracial couples were “manifestations of internalized white supremacy” and similar garbage. Lamentably, the “progressives” of yesteryear are not as open-minded as they like to think. 
This is simply the latest aristocratic moral panic by cynical elites and intra-class competition among the credentialed class. Cheered by the security services, the managerial maniacs are also trying to normalize the censorship of independent media through corporate and government channels, using a raft of excuses. This farce emanates from many of the same people who so eagerly lied the country into Iraq. 
The elite simply cannot comprehend why anyone would not trust them. The legacy media and the partisan hacks in new media are, predictably, the main beneficiaries. Even political party affiliation is not necessarily a reliable indicator of “loyalty,” since the rich own both media organs. As described in Taibbi’s Hate, Inc., this is a textbook example of divide and conquer. Many of the investors in pharmaceutical companies also fund anti-vaccination media outlets, hoping to benefit from any new viruses that emerge. 
As such, it’s normalized distrust of institutions, since the worst assumptions are often the most accurate. For example, there’s always eager support for the next war of choice, with dissent equated to support for the enemy. This is not a new trend for this particular group of elites, however. 
Always distrust those who would have you fear your own power. 
Blank Beginnings
I write this with both trepidation and excitement in my heart. I have just moved to a university in the Midwest, not far from where an online friend lives. I was fortunate enough to get this job thanks to an old collaborator who helped with the ClearMind transducer. I am going to be working on focused ultrasound for non-invasive neuromodulation. I am hoping that for once, I can have a secure position from which to build a research career.
The geopolitical scene around the world is a chaotic mess. With the 2022 US midterm elections approaching, the incumbent Democratic Party is trying to escalate every warzone in the world. So much harm has come to the foreign countries I’ve lived in—New Zealand, South Korea, and Singapore—from the figures in this administration. It started with dubious political prosecutions in New Zealand under John Key and then the Christchurch terrorist trained and unleashed by Ukraine’s Azov Battalion. South Korea was left out in the cold when they asked for help ending the Korean War. Even humble Singapore had its Trans-Pacific Partnership hijacked into a corporate lobbyist nightmare.
Then there are the problems in this country. Toxic identity politics, the exact sort discredited 30 years ago by Alan Sokal’s hoax, have now become the de facto dogma of the managerial class. Ideology is often downstream from power, mirroring how Silicon Valley’s business model atomizes the public into isolated individuals. The warmongers look to escalate conflicts in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa for cruel and cynical reasons that do not benefit the country or its true allies, even in the sense of an imperial realpolitik. Surveillance and censorship are now cherished by the managerial class, even though they spoke out against these things at the beginning of the War on Terror. New victimless crimes are created, threatening the very heart of American ingenuity and citizen science. 
Yet there are reasons for hope. Violent crime, terrorism, and racism of all sorts have decreased to a fraction of what it was in the 1990s. There is a void where new ideas might arise: concepts like a negative income tax or sovereign wealth funds to support an increasingly precarious public. These have been successfully executed in countries without the wealth and power of the US, and there only needs to be an increase in awareness. Within a generation, I even believe most houses will have automated software that can produce entirely novel designs from first principles and manufacture them on site. New inventions can pull water from the sky, make fuel from the air, and enable one to live a truly self-sufficient life without the constraints of nature. Our future is one of citizen science and decentralized abundance if we can imagine life beyond the sclerotic institutions of the present. 
Even in the darkest part of 2020, there was a discovery that gave me hope. A researcher at the University of Alabama found that the Brownian motion (the random molecular drift present in all materials above absolute zero) of graphene could generate a slight electrical current. This seemingly disproves the Nobel Prize-winning physicist, my hero Richard Feynman himself, who said that molecular vibration could not generate macroscale energy. Yet a professor at a land grant university in the Deep South has made a discovery that seemingly provides “free energy” or something effectively close.
In the far, far future, in the eon of deep time, the only power sources left will be dimming dwarf stars and black holes. The dwarf stars will eventually cool to embers, and the black holes will evaporate into Hawking radiation. The cosmic background temperature will grow colder but never approach absolute zero. In such an environment, even small amounts of current would be sufficient to run a civilization (as less power is required to flip a bit). In such a circumstance, graphene energy harvesting technology could keep civilization running long after the universe’s lights go out. One potential catch is the half-life of the material, but this is already an interval too vast and distant for most to imagine.
While 2020 brought me to the literal and metaphorical brink, that discovery may end up becoming the savior of sentient thought in the far future. In addition, it became the key component for my concept of a low-cost, relativistic micro-sized spacecraft that can potentially travel to Alpha Centauri and back in a decade or less. The stars may be open to us if we can only reach for them. Given the dropping costs of local manufacturing, it will not require a national space program or megacorporation to reach the stars. The asteroids in our system provide an infinite river of wealth, and someone will eventually claim them. Most concerns are closer to home, however.
No matter how the future unfolds, too many people will be struggling with poverty. Over a fifth of US families lost their life savings in the last year. I am fortunate in many ways. I have seen things, done things, and experienced things that no one else will. I would not have been able to do it without my friends and family. My discipline and persistence helped, but I would have failed long ago without my safety net. I know many misfits, weirdos, and interesting people around the world. Without venturing out of my parents’ house, I would have never met them. 
The same goes for the historical figures I admire. I only know them from secondary sources, but they give me something to aspire to. I try to be as skeptical of authority as Dr. Richard Feynman, Admiral Hyman Rickover, and Ida B. Wells. I want the courage to stand against overwhelming odds, like Yi Sun-shin, Te Ruki Kawiti, and Marcus Porcius Cato. I want to be able to build and invent things that endure from scratch, like Heron of Alexandria, Su Song, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, and Lee Kuan Yew. To me, these people represent some of the best that written history has to offer. They have their flaws, but who does not? 
The institutions of the old order are unraveling, as predicted decades ago in Future Shock by Alvin Toffler and America Against America by Wang Huning. However, there is ample room for something new to take their place. While there is potential for immense horror and suffering, there is also potential for something great. No institution is perfect, just as no person is. It is from the crisis that the basis for the next order emerges. I believe that as Americans and as members of the human race, the ghouls of the old order are dragging themselves to the cemetery. We just need to be ready to pounce. 
Many things could be next. Perhaps, like the pillarization of the Dutch Republic. political movements may form new social cores in a pluralistic society. Perhaps a de facto system of asymmetric federalism or federacy will emerge accordingly. Perhaps distributed polities, like in Neal Stephenson’s Diamond Age, will spring up among like-minded groups who set up cooperative communities connected online. Perhaps the old institutions will linger on, clunking and wheezing like used cars. All of these visions may come true, to a point. The future is a dark jungle, but there is hope.
I have been through many jungles in my life. I have been misled, cheated, stalked, attacked, and worse. Yet far more people have helped me. I trust the average person far more than the sheltered manager. Respect, persistence, and discipline are the only superpowers in real life, which is why they seem so rare. I aspire to these traits no matter where I am. I carry on for those who cannot. It can seem as though the present is a dark jungle where others fear to tread. However, I know I must never give up. 
Because in the jungle, the tiger hunts alone.
